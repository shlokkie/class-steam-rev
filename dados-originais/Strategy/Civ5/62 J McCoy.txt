-> Alexander started hating me for being a friend to his enemies and then ended up denouncing me to the world
-> After a few turns I had had enough of his crap and took over every single city he owned
-> A moment later I felt sort of "sorry" for him
-> As a merciful ruler, I gave him a tiny crappy city in the south pole of the world
-> He was still flipping me off
-> Destroyed his city and eliminated his units
-> He was never seen or heard from ever again and nobody cared
-> The world was bright once again

You could have just bought the game, but instead decided to waste your time on reading this unnecessary review. Thank you anyway :)

9/10

The best strategy game on steam.
