If you're new to Civlization, this is where to start. Everything is simplified for the better, even if you're new to stradegy, it has a lot of difficulty settings.
This is one of the best, most complete stradegy games once you buy its 2 expansion packs, Gods & Kings + Brave New World (Not needed but recommended)

There are 5 different types of victory, they are Cultural, Domination, Space misson, 2055 and Diplomatic. They are all fun to go for.

This is a stragey with some thinking involved and a lot of map/game options and great mods are on the workshop, so you could end up with hundreds and hundreds of hours eventually withnout noticing.
Basically, you start in anicents times and settle your first city with nothing, you have to then guide your Cilization to stand `The test of time` right through to 'da future!
Only ONE Civilization can be victorious. So aim for victory ahead of everyone else.

There is Multiplayer but I prefer not to stick to that 'due to people not finishing games.
A standared game can last litterly a full day. Recommended to anyone who hasn't played Civlization.
