CAN'T.....STOP.....PLAYING......ARRRGGGG!!!!

Very addictive and deep! It has grown wonderfully over the years and has GREAT support from the Steam Workshop. Endless replayability!

If you are new to the series, have no worries. Good ol' Sid will do you no wrong, as the tutorials will have you conquring Mongol Hordes and smacking down Washington's smarmyness in no time flat! Hours will fly by and your social life WILL suffer!! If you are a vetran of the series and have been holding out, check out the two expantion packs which add many interesting dynamics to gameplay easily making this the most exciting and in depth of the franchise.

I've had several friends sit down at my screen and start a new game, dispite them groaning about it not being an action game or something like Candy Crush (We all know the types!). Needless to say, coming back and seeing how they were doing 3+ hours later and noticing that they havn't changed position on their chair, has always been a moment that makes me smile. I have spread the addiction!!! Huzzah!

Do yourself a favor. Play this game.
