Damn, it's getting late. I should probably go to bed... I'll just play a few more turns.
Alright, one last turn.
Ooh, just unlocked railroads. I'll just install a few before leaving...
Alright, that's enough for today. One LAST turn and I'm going.

*Fifty or so turns later*

♥♥♥♥, Rome has declared war against me, better get some units moving to protect my borders.
Okay, last turn.
Hmm, I should probably heal my units before I forget.

*A hundred turns or so later*

ALRIGHT. LAST TURN.
Oooh... Unlocked flight. Sweet! Okay, I'll just build some fighters, then I'm going to sleep.

*Four hundred turns or so later*

OH. MY. GOD. Just unlocked the nuke. I DEFINITELY gotta try it! :D
