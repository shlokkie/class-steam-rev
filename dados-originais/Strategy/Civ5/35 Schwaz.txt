I hate this game. Here is basically how it goes.
Me: Time for some homework
Sid: yeeaaahh, that's not gonna happen
Me: No, no, NO, NO! FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE NOT SID AGAIN
Sid: haven't you ever wondered just how long a marathon game takes?
Me: no
Sid: why not find out?
Me: i have homework to do
Sid: *shreds my homework*
*takes 200 hours of my life*
