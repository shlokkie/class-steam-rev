Civilization V is the thinking man's game. It doesn't require lightning reflexes, speed or precision, however it is probably one of the most complex games ever created.

You're able to pick one of many civilizations to guide from 4000BC to the Present, allowing you to shape their culture, military and economic structure among others. You control everything, from where to build a city, how you allocate resources, scientific research, religion, espionage, tourism, corporations, and more.

The game has an extremely intricate diplomacy system as well which allows for you to befriend or antagonize the other civilizations. There are multiple ways to win a game, allowing for multiple play-styles.

As someone who has been playing the Civilization games for over 20 years, I strongly recommend Civilization V with all of its DLC.
