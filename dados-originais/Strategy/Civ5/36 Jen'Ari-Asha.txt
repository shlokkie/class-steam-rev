Me 9 PM last night
"Oh, im bored. I might aswell continue on my Civ V campaign for a few minutes."

11 and a half hours later

"Dear diary
I have now played Civilization V for almost 12 hours straight, i fear if i don't take a break soon i will never quit. I will soon need water and food, but i cannot leave my seat. Im not sure for how much longer i can make it.

I fear this might be my last note

Good bye"
