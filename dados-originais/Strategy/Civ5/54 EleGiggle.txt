A typical scenario every Civilization player will experience:

I, the great General Washington, led my courageous troupe of Yanks to victory after victory - our Muskets were far more advanced then anything our foes could muster!

Moments after wresting control of a pitiful city-state, I am alerted to the sudden appearance of a man - coated in war paint made of buffalo feces, clad in nothing more than a loincloth - who brandishes his bronze spear at me...

And proceeds to launch a barrage of nuclear missiles at New York.
