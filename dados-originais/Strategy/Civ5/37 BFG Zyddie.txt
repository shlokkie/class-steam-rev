So finally nearly 600 hours in Civi V and finally I believe I can give it a fair review.

So lets get the obv out of the way is Civi V good ? Yes otherwise I wouldn´t have spent 600 hours in it and still booting it up now and then.

Civi V lacks nothing on graphics or gameplay, it is top of the line and there it is 100´s of mods for those who wishes to change their gameplay in anyway possible.

Civi V is not as detailed or brutally hard as the former games in this installment, however that is a great thing in my eyes as it gets a lot of new players to test out the series that the rest of us have enjoyed for so many years.

The DLC`s Gods & Kings and Brave New World adds a lot of the things we are use to from ealier series and is diffenetly worth getting for anyone who likes the more complex version of the Civi series, that beeing said the other DLC`s is mainly just new maps or new nations to play with and really only something you should pickup if you are a huge fan or on sale.

So Civi is as it always have been, you start with a settler and one more unit and here you go form a nation that will stand the test of time. There is multiple ways to achive victory and it is important that you play to your nations strenghts and use your enemies weaknesses through the different time periods of our planet. This is classic Civi after all.

Tho do not let it fool you, Civi is a game that takes a long time often 6+ hours pr map and often one nation is just gonna hate you more than anyone else, in my case it was Poland wich wanted to nuke and kill me no matter what, they did a good job sometimes too.

All in all a great game and a great installment of the Civi series that brings a lot of new players and a lot of life into the series, so if you like complex games that takes time and patience then make sure you pick it up!
