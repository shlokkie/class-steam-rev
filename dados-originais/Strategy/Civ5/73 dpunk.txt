This game is one of a kind. Well, along with Civilizations 1, II, III, and IV.

If you enjoyed other Civilizations games, it's highly likely you will enjoy this one as well.

There are a few things that are notably different from other versions of Civilizations.

The most obvious is the units per tile restrictions. In Civ 5, there is only allowed 1 unit type per tile, meaning only 1 combat unit can be on any tile. In some ways it's better, in some it's worse, but it does lend itself to strategy of positioning of your army being much more important than in earlier versions.

Another is that cities, when attacked, take damage themselves instead of any unit defending. I believe it's related to the 1 unit type per tile, because it would be odd if you only had to kill one unit to take a city.

These two differences from earlier versions does give the game a different feel from earlier versions, but it does still feel much more similar to Civilizations than it does to a game like Colonization/Civ4Col, although not that it would be a bad thing if it was similar to Colonization, another great Sid Meier game.

Overall I highly recommend it to anyone considering, just make sure you have time to play because you will be hooked.
