Civ 5 is the kind of game where you can try to be nice and befreind everyone, but you will get denounced. they will murder your people and pillage your cities. When you attempt to fight back you are labeled a warmonger, and obviously the only way to stop getting warmonger penalties is to slaughter all those that oppose you right? If you destroy 1 civ might as well destroy them all because they will not let you live that down. Also Ghandi Destroyer of worlds will wreck you if you don't give him all your uranium for him to build nukes to nuke you with. 10/10 would fight Ghandi Destroyer of Worlds again
