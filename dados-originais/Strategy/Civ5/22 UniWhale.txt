-Puts on Morgan Freeman voice-
Now children, settle down, I'm going to tell you about our history.
Many a millions of years ago, there were 6.
Oda the peaceful.
Bismark the rich.
Siam the literate.
Ghengis Kahn the powerful.
Washington the productive.
And Ghandi the *Cough* Peaceful.
For many thousands of years they lived peacefully in harmony and tranquility, trading as they pleased.
Then it changed.
Ghandi had risen an army in secret. One far more powerful than should ever have been made.

-Falls into the mind of Oda Nabunaga-

The troops had moved out on the fields that day, on their way to fight the Indian threat.
The war raged on for many a thousands of years when we made the push. We burned the Indian cities 'till they were but glass! We were victorious. The war was over. The world was safe.
But then, crawling out of the ash and flame of a burned civilization was...
One.
More.
City.
Troops amassed outside it. It was an Indian city
Gahndi wasn't gone...
I saw the numbers above his city and was thinking "What is that...?"
Then I heard the air raid sirens and saw the missles launch on what was the last day of my life.
They hit every city. Burning them, irradiating them.
As I sat there, in my throne room I had one last thought.
One last memory that would carry me over.
And it was...
"Well played Ghandi...Well played."

P.S. For those who didn't get the hint: Ghandi...just Ghandi...
