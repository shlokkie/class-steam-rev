Gandhi declares war on Bismarck's German Empire.

Soon after, Gandhi strikes Berlin, Hamburg, and Essen with Nuclear Missiles.

The Ottomans, concerned with Gandhi's warmongering, denounce the Indian leader.

They soon lose their capital.

Bismarck, his economy and army in ruins, pleads for peace with the Indian Empire, but Gandhi will only stop with full annexation of the German Reich.

An alliance of Poland, Gengis Khan's Mongolian Empire, and the Aztecs turn on Gandhi in hopes of stopping his rampage.

Warsaw falls.

Karakorum falls.

Tenochtitlan falls.

Gandhi reins supreme. The world is in his grasp. He is on the verge of doing what men, for thousands of years, have dreamed of: Conquering the world under one banner.

But none of that matters, because the Babylonians have just won a science victory by launching a single little rocket into space. It makes too much sense.

10/10, but be warned:

Gandhi will find you.

Gandhi will kill you.

And Gandhi

Always

Gets

His

Kill.
