My civ was only 6000 years old. I loved Gandhi so much, I had traded all my resources to him. I prayed to Gandhi every night before bed, thanking him for the civ I had been given.

Gandhi is love I said, Gandhi is life.

Russia hears me and publicly denounces me. I knew he was just jealous, of my devotion to Gandhi. I declared war on him, he attacks me and forces me to sign a peace treaty.

I'm crying now, and my city is hurt. I lay in defeat and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch my civ.

Its Gandhi.

I'm so happy. He whispers to me: "this is my land."

He grabs me with his powerful Indian army, and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my army for Gandhi. He penetrates my border. It hurts so much, but I do it for Gandhi.

I can feel my army dying, as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Gandhi. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my civ with his nukes.

Russia walks in. Gandhi looks him straight in the eye, and says "It's all fallout now." Gandhi waves through my borders.
