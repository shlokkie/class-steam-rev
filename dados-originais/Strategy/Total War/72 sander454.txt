As a veteran of the series, I must admit this game feels very shallow and completely without any depths. The way how CA simplify this game makes you wonder if this will be first Total War title that will be ported to consoles. Overpowered agents, AI that can't conduct siege attack, or making sensible choices (like Rome army enjoying cruise on sea when all they cities were taken).
On the top of that horrible, horrible optimization that is really affecting performance. CA gave us 7 patches yet it seems like we will need at least 7 more to maybe past beta version.
Stay away for time being - maybe in the future or if you can find it for less than Â£10, then buy it. Otherwise spend your money on something different.
