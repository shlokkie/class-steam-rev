I've long been a fan of the Total War series, and Roman history in general; in fact, the original Rome: Total War ranks as one of my favorite games of all time, and I logged in countless hours in grueling grand campaigns, doubly so with the added depth and fun of some great mods, like Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥.

It's a terrible shame, then, that Rome 2 is such a disappointment, in almost every way imaginable. To start, while previous iterations of the game occasionally grew stale without mods, the vanilla games were still engrossing enough to be worth playing on their own; sadly, this is no longer the case here, and in fact vanilla seems broken, requiring mods to even function properly. Second, while the game is indisputably gorgeous, it seems like something of an unwieldy beast, bringing my computer to a crawl even on the campaign map, and lasting an eternity between turns. But perhaps one aspect I found deeply underwhelming was the household management: the new system is pared down even from Shogun 2's rather barebones set-up, and it's a far cry from the original Rome or Medieval 2. 

Admittedly, this has never been the core part of the game, but it was a seemingly small aspect that could do wonders for immersion and replayability, not to mention the inherent fun in roleplaying. But in an age of Crusader Kings 2, this even more rudimentary roleplaying aspect is just striking, and just sapped what little interest I could muster in the game. In fact, this is perhaps the first time I really regret purchasing a game on Steam. Hopefully, the game will improve, but it's disappointing that in this day and age we should have to settle for "eventually playable" even when paying upwards of $60 for AAA games, when other companies are putting out quality products out of the gate for 2/3 the price. At this point, I would not recommend the game at all, maybe not even on sale.
