The worst total war game ever made. It was released months ago and still feels buggy and unfinished. Most of the core strategic elements have been dumbed down or stripped out. Creative Assembly has gone off their rocker; every other game in the series, even with problems, was good at the core... but this one is rotten. 

The DLC is overpriced and worthless also. New factions play almost the same way.
