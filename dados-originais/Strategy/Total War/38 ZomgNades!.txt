The AI is abysmal. I can defend a city with only 300 against 4000 all because the AI decides it wants to use a gate all the way across the city instead of climbing the walls or storming the gate in front of it. The current political intrigue seems useless and I try to ignore it now. Lastly the auto resolve feature, common to all Total War games, is incorrect in almost all regards. You can have such a superior army and it still have you in the red. Fight it out and you only lose a fraction of your units, 10 out of 10 times this occurs.
