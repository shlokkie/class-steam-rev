Get Rome 1 and a couple mods, or get Medieval II with the EBII mod, far more worth your money.

How the battles look: It's better in the Emperor edition because at least units don't smush into a fluid ball when they fight. That's all. Units don't collide realistically, they run at each other and then clank to a halt all at the exact same time, all reacting to orders, changing direction in the exact same way all at the exact same time. They are not human. Soldier-to-soldier interaction is done only via a set animation, so there is no flexibility in the combat, it is decided by stats alone and because it is just one-on-one, advantages in numbers cannot be used to full effect.

Music: Makes me cringe, doesn't play most of the time and actually sucks life out of the game. All the songs sound nearly the same too. They used different composers throughout the series - Jeff van Dyck composed the Rome 1, Medieval II and Shogun 2 soundtracks and they are bloody awesome. Just listen to "War of Kings" from the medieval II Kingdoms expansion.

DLC whoring: Vicious and aggressive. You want the Greek States? They're already in the game, coded in there, but you have to pay to unlock them. You don't download anything, you just unlock stuff.
