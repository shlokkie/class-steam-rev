Major letdown to me. When I first watched the trailers, the interviews, the ideas and visuals were amazing. None lived up to that. 

The core game is the poorest it has ever been in a total war game. I never feel like I'm achieving anything in this game. I play and play hoping something amazing will happen but everything falls short.

Every culture is not diverse, it does not feel that way at all. Instead, it feels all the same. From rome to egypt, i don't get a sence of diversity I get a sence of, what... again?

The lack of control over how cities expand and grow and even the poor way you upgrade cities. That has led to a feeling of I don't care about my cities. My terroritory that I control never feels like mine. It feels borrowed permanantly. It's like a asked the greeks if I could come over and party with their women. Instead of partying I stole their women and ran off. Only if taking something in this game was as fun as steal women from greeks.

Atleast in that scenerio you would get a thrill. 

From the redundant building patterns that are identical in every city. The lack of depth in strategy is poor. I never feel the need to choose what I need to build or upgrade for my general or even for my army traditions. There is never a concern that something will be lost. Never a concern that I am clinging onto the game. It doesnt' give me a feeling of panic or terror, not even joy, but most of all it doesn't make me feel like an emperor or that I'm running a country, it makes me feel like I'm setting at a computer. This game takes me nowhere.
