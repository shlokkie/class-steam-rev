The worst game in the Total War series. Gimmicky, butchered in DLC, uberpatched to death, lacking any optimisation at all and with an angering stupid AI, this game truly is the pinnacle of greediness. As a diehard fan of history, enthusiast of strategy games and longstanding follower of Total War, I can't help but feel frustrated with a game that had so much potential, and raised so much hype. Total War: ROME II is the very definition of disappointing. It doesn't only invert the title (from Rome: Total War), but the series overall.

As Empire proved to be a hard (buggy) step, Rome II is just pure misdirection. Maybe the first game (the first Rome) wasn't historically accurate at all, or had any nice animations, but it was really enjoyable. I would NOT recommend this game to ANYONE, not even to fans, and especially not to newcomers. It is a complete catastrophe.
