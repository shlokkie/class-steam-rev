Really disappointing game. Concept and legacy are promising, but after 3 months and 7 patches the developer still hasn't managed to fix the terrible frequent crashes, horrible frame rates and graphic glitches (This is not because of my system it's community wide). The AI is a mess and the game fails to entertain in the long run. The multiplayer is plagued by desync issues as well. Not recommended at all.
