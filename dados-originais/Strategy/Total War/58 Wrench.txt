Broken game, broken company full of bull and finally my heart is broken. Been with this fanchise from the beginning and I sadly don't know if I'll ever buy a CA game from this point on. Sad, very sad. Could have been a great game but is just flat and tedious.

Edit: Now they have the balls to set a date for the first major DLC so soon when the core is still so broken at the very basic level. Not even talking optimization here. Really shocking. I wouldn't even gift this to my worst enemies. I just am in shock.

Edit 2: Beasts of war...really...Just one face palm after another. Don't waste your cash.
Edit 3: While I still do not agree with the buisness practices of CA, I would like to amend my review a bit. After many patches and with extensive mods this game is much better. If I could give it a side-ways thumb I would. Disapointed it took so long to "fix", 7.5/10

DEI and Radious are the only reason to play this half game.
