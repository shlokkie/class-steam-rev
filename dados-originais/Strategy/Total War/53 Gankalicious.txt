So many other total war fans have left (negative) passionate reviews detailing what is wrong with this game. Like them I wanted to like it. Rome 1 remains my most played game of all time and enthralled me for almost 18 months straight. To say that I was excited for Rome 2 is an understatement. My dissapointment is great but ultimately my review comes down to this:

It's boring and lifeless and that's the worst thing I could possibly say about any game. The 100+ hours I put in were in an effort to find the fun. I didn't succeed, but it did lead me to re-buy Medieval II and pick up Shogun II for $8 during a sale. I know I'll find the fun by rolling back the clock.

Avoid this game if you're a total war fan. If not, meh, maybe take a chance if you find it for a fiver, but the older games are better.
