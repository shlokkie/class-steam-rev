Launched with many bugs that made the game unplayable. However, 14 patches later and I can finally say that this game is worth buying and playing. I have stuck with it through this time since I wanted to get my money's worth out of it... and now I can say that I have, and I can recommend it to anyone else who is a fan of strategy and Total War games in general.
