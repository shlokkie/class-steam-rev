This game was an incredible disappointment for me. I have always been a fan of the Total War Games and loved the first Rome Total War. Having said that this game takes almost every element that i enjoyed and thought was improved upon in previous games and removed them. Either that or dumbed them down so much that it isnt even enjoyable. Don't get me wrong there is some good in this game but the bad almost makes it unplayable for me.
