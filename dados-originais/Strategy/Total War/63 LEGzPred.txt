While this game has a lot of potential I feel that it fails to delived the "total war" experience. The lack of a sofisticated AI (probably the worst I've seen in a long time) along with a poorly optimized engine and bland UI makes this a total nightmare to play. With that said I wouldn't recommend it right now "as is", although keep your eyes open for new patches, these might fix some of the issues.
