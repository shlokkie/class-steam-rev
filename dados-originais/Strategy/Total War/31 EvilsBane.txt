Too many stripped features, too much DLC that should have been in the game in the first place, too many siege battles ( which don't work ) and defenatly too many hours played. I still remember my first general from my first campaing as the scipii in rome 1. He was a true hero of the republic who consolidated sicily and north africa. He died of old age, and later his son came to be a great leader himself whom I gave the city of carthage ( his fathers greatest conquest ) to manage in a time of war against the Numedian tribes... I dont remember one of my generals in rome 2, and I simply don't care about them... I wish I did but they are just lifeless.
