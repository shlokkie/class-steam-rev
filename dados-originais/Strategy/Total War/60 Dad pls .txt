Braindead AI, awful optimization, clunky big UI, unit cards with lack of information, lack of loose formation for the vast majority of the units, siege battles are a joke when you can zerg the gate down with torches, naval battles are just extremely awful with ships not doing what they are ♥♥♥♥ing told, and much much more.

Stay away from this awful excuse of a strategy game.
