OUR MEN FLEE THE FIELD OF BATTLE!!! THIS IS A SHAMEFULL DISPLAY
AN ENTIRE UNIT HAS PERISHED
OUR GENERAL HAS FALLEN
THE MEN ARE WAVERING
THE MEN ARE WAVERING
THE MEN ARE WAVERING 
THE MEN ARE WAVERING
THE ENEMY GENERAL...IS...DEAD

seriously, this is the most useless advisor i have ever seen in a total war, but i guess we don't need one since the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥, and you can kick their ♥♥♥ without effort even if your men are wavering.

In medieval II however your advisor actually gives you advice and can help you. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ however is extremely annoying and only spams saying the obvious things.

I would not have recommended it at all at release, but with the emperor edition and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of mods its actually a decent game, but i would recommend getting it only when its a sale for at least 75% off.

11/10 would let the men waver again
