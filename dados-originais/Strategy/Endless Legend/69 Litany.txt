Endless legend does alot of things right, and a few things wrong. The overall experience is however masterfull and a joy to behold.

Firstly the things it does wrong:
-The game has a tutorial that goes as far as explaining the tried and tested tropes of the genre. It fails to explain the intricacies of what Endless Legend offers beyond this. Adding layers of complexity where little external resource exists to fill you in. The steam copy of the manual is actually usefull for once, but Learning to play a modern day game especially one that innovates in so many ways, shouldn't involve reading a 70 page pdf.
-The difficulty and overall balancing is out of wack. This only time will heal, and it will, knowing amplitudes excellent track record with supporting their tittles post launch. The best way to play this game at release is with other human beings who are as fallable and new to the experience as you.
-The combat system removes power from the player in an attempt to streamline what is often the most tedious part of the genre, player agency is important in all game genres and unless I as the player have explicitly surrendered it, it should never be taken away.
-The quest system feels pinned on to the experience the game already offers, and doesn't stand up as it's own thing, You can tell the potential and desire to enhance it was there by the devs but to date it's been squandered.

Now quickly the things that it does right:
-A slick, clean, effective, forward thinking and wholly PC interface. No big picture or touch screen nonsense here tyvm.
-Asymetrical faction design. Making each and every one of the different faction play in a unique and different way. This adds to the multiplayer joy, a 30 hour trade war mirror game where the players can't declare war on each other? priceless. An expansion faction versus a tall single city empire? totaly legit. The options are there and out of the hands of the AI totaly viable.
-It's beautifull. I've never liked blur in video games before, but whoever designed the art style of this game knew all the right things about lens shifting and lighting. And a niche love of papercrafts maybe?
-Combat. Yes it in part removes player agency forcing you to fight for control but other innovations make up for this. The combat the most arduos part of this genre is hastened by spontanious (or double spontanious) turns and a 6 turn turn limit. Combat never feels obtrusive and is actualy worth investing time in thanks to these design decisions.
-Tile exploitation and cities. This one is probably preference and others may disagree with me, but the way cities expand and exploit the FIDS resource system is very rewarding, feels organic and empowers the player. You'll learn to love triangles and spiral patterns in a weird way I swear.
-Soundtrack and art. The word eargasm doesn't exist. But it should for this very reason. The ost captures the hybrid fantasy lowtech sci-fi setting brilliantly as does the art.

Is it worth buying? I judge a games worth if I enjoy playing it over it's price in £ converted into hours. I got my copy cheap as part of a subscription service to IGN, but it retails at around £30. Check my hour count and you'll see that I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.
