It's literally Heroes of Might and Magic mixed with Sid Meier's Civilization.

What more do you want?

Just don't play the tutorial. 
It's awful and dosen't explain much. 
The UI is simple, but takes getting used too, after a quick warm-up round you'll be good to go if you explore it some. 
Hell, you will get a basic idea of what to do if you take a moment and read through the factions triats. 

The combat feels uninvolved at first glance, but it's more on how you tell your troops to do things. You can tell them what to do, to the letter if you learn to use the unit tactics, as they tend to do their own thing unless you tell them not too. 
I played some multiplayer, and it definetly showed the difference it makes to interact with your troops compared to just telling them who to attack as you can better control the field and force them into narrow areas in the terrain, or into some troops you have on the high ground. In other words, it was a massacre, not a battle. 
I'm so sorry to that Broken Lords Player, whoever you were. 
Should of accepted the peace treaty, bruh. 

Overall, good stuff. I'll play this over Civ anyday.
