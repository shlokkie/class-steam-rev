More empire building focused than AoW, faster paced than civ and takes all the best mechanics from Endless Space. If you're familiar with the Endless lore, there will be lots of 'Ahhhhhhhh' moments as you realise which factions are like the Endless Space factions (there is continuity). 

Overall it's a pretty strong 4x game - there's a lot of victory conditions (including a main quest), and every faction plays differently. The factions are designed well and while I couldn't debate balance with you, all of the factions are fun to play (♥♥♥♥ the cultists though - my minor faction towns are MINE GO AWAY). Some of the factions are actually designed by community users, too; pretty sure that's the cultists again.

Score: Dank/10, would get backstabbed by the Cultists in the depths of winter again.
