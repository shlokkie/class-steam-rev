(Review for version #[1.0.24] #2014/12/11)

Endless Legend is a 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate; Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example of the 4X-era) turn-based fantasy game.

It's really difficult - for an old strategist like me - to find something wrong within the game. 
+The visuals are stunning, 
+the soundtrack is harmonic and match the turn-based gameplay, 
+the combat system is simple, yet interesting,
+a modern transparent UI,
+Customizable race and units and 
+Mod support.
(Also the lore is quite fascinating)

But! - like every pro - there is critic:
-Like in other strategy-games, there's a lack of AI-performance. If you turn up the difficulty, it will just provide higher buffs (like more money, more science etc.) for the AI. It could simulate a challenge for someone, but for others it's just cheating and unfair. (I will deny my own opinion in this regard)


Overall, good stuff. Not bad for an Indie-game. This game tried some new ideas and implemented those successful.
8.5/10
