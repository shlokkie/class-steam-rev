Pretty damn good game. It has a medium learning curve because you can build and use your empire how you want to.
Unlike most 4x games its not as much about expanding your empire as it is building it up.
You are not confined to a tech line and they really made this game open ended and customizable for the player.

The closest this game can be discribed is imagine civ and heros of might&magic had child; this would be the result. 

There is so much that could be said about this game but ill narrow it down in four words. Deep Fun innovative and sandboxy like a 4x should be.

Each faction is totally diffrent and does not have the cookie cutter races that only differ slightly from eachother. One faction can only build one city. Another faction can move there citys becouse they are nomatic. Another faction doesnt eat food but consumes a diffrent resource. Another faction eats well,, other factions citizens!! Its great!

The Heros are amazing and have the MOO2 govener feel to them. Did I mention all the side quests in the game? Yes there are those too.

I can go on and on about all the neat things you can do in this game that are just ingenous but all I have to say is; This game is simply a fresh take and a instant classic. I have no regret buying it.

Only down side is there are a few small bugs to get squashed yet.
