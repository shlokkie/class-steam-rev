Endless Legend is a unique 4x turn based fantasy game. The map has regions, and to own a region means owning all of the reources in that region. Regions are gained by building or conquering cities. There are nice unit customizations, and it is possible to acquire minor faction units as well.

The game has decent graphics. Exploring the map is fun. Ruins give payouts or quests. There are neat quests in the game.

The AI is not he toughest. I usually auto fight my battles, but the AI puts up more of a challenge in tactical combat. Range of units is a little low, and manuevering is vital to win.

Endless Legend is a fun game to play.
