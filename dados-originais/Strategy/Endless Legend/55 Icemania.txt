If you enjoy a well crafted 4X game and don't mind what is currently a generally weak and inconsistent AI (particularly militarily) then Endless Legend is highly recommended. If your 4X play style is solely military this game may seem too easy at the moment. However, hopefully Amplitude will improve the AI in coming patches with some changes made already and a track record of good community engagement.

I've found the game immersive enough to play for 80 hours already using different factions with different styles of play, units and quests. I'm completely hooked at the moment! There are still a few factions left to play, so while longevity will be limited until the AI is improved, the game represents a good investment. The professionalism of the games development stands out in many ways. The user interface is easy to use, the music is terrific, the graphics are beautiful for a 4X game and the tactical combat is vastly improved over Endless Space. I've had no crashes or seen any bugs with a material impact.

Amplitude have developed a really good 4X game. I only hope that they deliver AI Improvements in patches and also give the AI far more focus before their next release.
