I bought in during early access and clocked quite a few games in both single and multi-player as well as put in a fair bit of time ont he forums. The progress has been great and the Devs worked with people pretty well on finding and fixing issues -- On top fo that the Cultist faction was completely community built, another neat addition.

As far as a 4x game goes this one is right up there with any of the big-names that you may or may not have played in terms of fun and I can't recommend it enough if you are a fan of games like Civ though don't go in expecting a reskin of one of their games -- The Devs put a great spin on some classic systems while still keeping some good core gameplay.

Definitely check it out ^_^
