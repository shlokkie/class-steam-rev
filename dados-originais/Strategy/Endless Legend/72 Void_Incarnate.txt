Great game - with caveats.

It's times like this I wish Steam had a more granular recommendation option, because there really is a lot to like about this game. It's gorgeous, the art design is amazing, the playable factions are unique and interesting and the music is also great. The beginning game is a lot of fun (if somewhat daunting for newbies), but the game starts to bog down in the late game. The problem is that the challenges don't scale as you level up, so combat becomes inconsequential, and the game goes from being a fun turn based strategy game into an excruciatingly boring "resource management" chore.

Master of Magic struck the right balance, with high level enemies and challenges to keep the player engaged. Once you've reached a high enough level in Endless Legend, there is little reason to move your armies around the map, and the game devolves into just allocating your city populations between resource priorities.

Still a very good game, if you love spreadsheets.
