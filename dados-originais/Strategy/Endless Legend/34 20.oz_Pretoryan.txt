A visible improvement from Endless Space. 

Thing that impressed me the most is the UI. It really feels like it flows nicely, with beautiful art that will make browsing through data feel really natural and not at all painful. Its easy to navigate, and acess anything you need without being cluttered. 

- Heroes and Units now have a fantasy setting gear you can equip them with and improve it through tech and resources.
- Random factions and armies that roam the regions are challenging and will go against players, similar to barbarian behaviour in CiV.
- Overall art and visual effects are quite impressive, even featuring little things - like separate intro movie in MP depending on which faction you play - that to me at least really mean a lot.

It is a lot different then Endless space. It is a good hexagonal RTS , which I would really recommend if you find yourself liking games like Civilization, Warlock and alike.
