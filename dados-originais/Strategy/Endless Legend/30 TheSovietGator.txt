A must buy, its basically Civ 5 except fantasy and just a little more complex. Its so cool to see the tiny details in the game, like the little bugs swarming around an evil bee hive faction. And the little dwarf people using the titanium axes that you made them. An amazing and truly unique game, 5 out of 5.
