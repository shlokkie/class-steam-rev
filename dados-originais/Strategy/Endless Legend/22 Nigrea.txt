Really great 4X stratagy game.
A lot of the mechanics are very similiar to their earlier title, Endless Space. 
The game has a lot of depth to it, and a large amount of very different races, which all have their own, unique mechanics.
While most of the playable races are based and inspired by your stereotypical fantasy races (Elves, Humans, Dragons etc.), the lore and art design behind them always seems to have a creative and diverse flavore to them.
As mentioned, the mechanics and depth of stratagy are both very solid and the game ends up being incredibly addictive.
It really has that classic "just one more turn" feel, highly recommendet if you have many hours to waste!
