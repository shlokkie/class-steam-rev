Update after full launch:

7/10

This game has officially failed to become a good 4X game. It has some outstanding ideas, notably the heroes, the weapon systems, and the quest system. It has some quirky ideas that don't quite meet their full potential, such the incredibly unique and varied races and the tactical battles. Then it's got some neat ideas that just don't work, like the province system. At the end of the day, this is a great try and injects some life into the 4X genre, but it's missing the mechanics of other greats that prevent it from being fully recommended. *CAVEAT: I should actually say that I am a peace-loving hippie; this game may very well cater towards you warmongers... 

Pros:
- Downrigth gorgeous, with stellar art and graphics
- Excellent strategic pre-battle planning for your units and heros
- Fun quests, especially since each race has their own unique storyline
- Great race selection, albiet with flaws (see below)
- It really is a servicable 4X game, and is fun enough in its own right

Quirky idea shout-out:
- I loved the tech where you can make all-merc armies neutral, then have them wollop on you friends without them knowing it is you. 

Good tries:
- Tactical combat
- Racial abilities don't always work as anticipated, or are not as useful as the developer's thought
- Complex trade and diplomatic systems; the problem here seems to be AI, not the system. Excellent ideas.

Big Issue that was never fixed:
- There are still missing explanations for game mechanics, which is nigh unforgivable in such a complex game. 

Cons:
- Province/district system really shoehorns your expansion and negates any real need for protection of non-city areas. 
- Utter lack of customization of districts or landscape; incredibly dissapointing given the fascinating take in Endless Space.
- Because of the above two problems, the mid-game is incredibly dry if you don't want to fight everyone; you simply set up a build and research cue, then hit end turn (as opposed to micromanage tiles, planets, etc.)
- Further, expanding your city is not that fun since you take huge hits in happiness every time you do (which, if you think about it, is bass ackward). 
- FIDS system, or rather the DS (dust and science) part of it, make unique cities unnecessary and pointless; each city can easily produce everything.
- Laying seige to a town is odd; it is completely necessary, but is so easy it feels as though it is not. 
- Playing with an emphasis on ranged combat gives you a huge advantage with just a minor understanding of tactics.
- No sea or air combat, and very limited sea exploration/exploitation


Original EA review:
To start, this game has tons of potential. The base buliding is fantastic, it exudes character (for example, each race has a unique quest/storyline with rewards), and the combat is a unique take on 4X games. Also, I love the way they are approaching diplomacy (it depends a little on its own resource, which makes it easier when playing with the AI). 

Of course, this is early access. Now, normally I am 100% against early access games. They lack polish, they are buggy as hell, etc. The same is true of Endless Legend. The biggest problem: the utter and complete lack of explanation of anything. So, why a thumbs up for this one? Because Amplitude did it right and is giving a 25% discount! Hot damn people, we've got good marketing and benefits for all! 

I'll update when I've played more, but for now, this already awesome looking game is being offered at a significant discount and is enjoyable enough right to sink a few hours here and there. Definitely the best EA game on the market right now.
