Take Civ V, remove the limitation of one unit per hex, add in actual terrain elevation, make the different factions play differently, remove the million-city strategy by enforcing separated regions, change battle from "my number is bigger" to small tactical engagements, and give individual military units more significance than "rifleman #14", at the cost of a shallower tech tree and a debatable "winter" mechanic that cripples any empire not ready for it by turn 200+. This is what a sequel to Civ V should have been. Given the choice between this or Beyond Earth, buy this twice.
