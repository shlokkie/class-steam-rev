Endless Legends is a beautifully crafted game that rates at the top of the 4x genre. The game pace is somewhat slower but the quality of the game and the story lines built in to the game make it worth playing over and over, 

For gameplay and asthetics I prefer Endless Legends over the new Civ BE which I also have. Both are great games but BE is really another Civ with some nice new features and additions where Endless Legends is a new game with a complimentary story line that takes place in the pre Endless Legends universe.

If you buy it you will not be sorry. As a new game there are still some tech glitches and AI issues to be worked on but I have played for well over a month with no errors or crashes so it is well on the way to be another classic.
