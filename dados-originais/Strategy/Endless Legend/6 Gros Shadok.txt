This is the most surprisingly great game I've ever seen on Steam.
Surprising because considering the small price, and considering I'm a fan of the Civilization saga since the first one, I was expecting a nice game inspired by Civilization but certainly not as good.
Well I was wrong. This game is at least as good as Civilization and may be even slightly better because :
- it has way better graphics (including a real 3D map with elevations : on the contrary to Civ you can 'climb' hills to reach a plateau for example to shoot arrows from above... and of course this gives you bonus) and a very cool and modern User interface
- it has RPG elements (quests but also a good heroes management in which you can customize the equipement and also chose specilizations like you do in any RPG)
- it has turn based battles (which I love... but you still can use automatic battle resolution if you prefer)
- it has seasons with real effects on the game
- it has an interesting units customization feature (in Civ the upgrade system is more basic here you can equip you units with new shield, armor, weapons but also items that give some extra points... it's very RPG inspired)
- it has a very usefull and well made training.
So, it is a good combo of TRPG and 4X games. Exactly what, personnaly, I was looking for for a long time !!!
