Lets start with the bad one :
- Bad AI, if you are veteran in Civ games, then start your difficulty above normal, although this is your first campaign
- No need to fight in manual mode, just play in auto, save your time. Unless you fight another human player
- Need more polished animation

Now the good one :
- Fresh gameplay, not another typical Civ games. Although seem weird for the first time, but you will enjoy it later.
- Different faction, different strategy. And you have faction quest. Its awesome! Finish the quest to unravel the story.
- Unlimited replaybility.
- Great artwork, beatifull, love it. That season change is amazing!
- Good soundtrack, need more creepy music though.

This game has more potential, need more scenario, need more faction, need more magical wonder, or super badass monster who can wipe all faction alone. There will be DLC no doubt. So if you fans of Fall from Heaven Mod in Civ 4 like me. Then this game is for you. Cheers~
