This game was catching dust in my library for a couple of years. I thought I have seen it all and played it all, until one day I just gave XCOM:EU a go. I was instantly hooked!

XCOM is engaging and keeps you on the edge. Every battle matters, every decision you make in the command centre matters. The get attached to your squad and you cheer as they get promoted, get new gear to kick ♥♥♥. It all plays out brilliantly. This game is one the greats, no doubts about. One that I will be playing for a long time to come.

PS: Get the expansion as well. Worth every penny.
