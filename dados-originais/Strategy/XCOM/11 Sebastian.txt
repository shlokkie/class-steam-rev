I could tell you about the many times I played through this game's campaign. About Enemy Within, and the chances it brought. About the mod Long War and how it turns this great game into an epic marathon.
But you don't want to hear that. You want to know if this particular game is worth your money and your time.

In short: It is.

This is game about adaptation. About turning the weapons and technologies of the invaders against them, about choosing where to pool your limited resources, or where to send your troopers to fight, knowing some may not return.
And boy, does it hurt when your beloved sniper, the one you've been watching over from the start, that guy that could always be counted to nail a crit at extreme distances. He has just died because you send your fire team ahead and he was left behind to offer support... until a flanking alien killed him in cold blood. That's X-COM. Those memorable moments that happen amidst the familiar landscapes. You'll also offer silent prayer to that unfortunate civilian that had to die so that you could hit that alien cluster arround him with a rocket.

In terms of crunch, the tactical aspect is very solid. A large part of the battlefield can be brought down, and so can your cover, making each battle less about hunkering down and dealing and taken fire and more about manuevering. A flanking, agile soldier can become just as deadly as the one hunkered down behind a wall with the giant machine gun.

A very enjoyable game, with engaging mechanics and a smart AI that makes for very emotional, un-scripted moments.
