Simply the best turn based strategy game i have played to date.
You can easily play for hours and not even notice.
However, the best feature by far is the deep connection you form with your squad. I had friends tell me this would happen, but I thought it was just over-exageration, I mean the soldier are just game characters right?
Then I lost my first soldier and cried manly tears for hours at the demise of Ross "Trigger" Williams...damn floater.

10/10 would cry over loss of imaginary friend again
