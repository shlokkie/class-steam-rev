I send my digital dudes into the crusher that is the alien menace, some get flattened and fill up digital cemeteries, others are chewed up, but spit out. stronger. angrier. And with a thirst for alien blood. But usually i just restart because my favorite dude with a nickname like "Nunchucks" or "Armadillo" gets sniped and I can't handle the loss.
