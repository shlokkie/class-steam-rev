Alphabetically one of the last games on my backlog, I thought I'd never get around to this.

This game tells the tragic tale of an Argentenian man who watched his friends die in the tutorial mission, went on to obtain over 100 confirmed alien kills, developed psychic powers, and died in a ship as it flew into space and collapsed in on itself like a neutron star.

It's all written from the point of view of a psychic Irish man with a sniper rifle--the only one to survive the final mission and tell the tale.
