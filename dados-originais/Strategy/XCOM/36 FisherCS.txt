Addictive and hard to master. This game will teach you to think rationally before taking any action. You need to manage your squad, HQ, and also the Council.

What I Love
1. Random mission.
2. Great atmosphere.
3. Squad's role with leveling system
4. Different enemy type with its own tactical behaviour.
5. Base management

What I Don't Like
1. Sometimes can be really hard (even on Easy difficulty)
2. Story?

Fit for someone who looking for great tactical turn-based strategy and someone who loves management game.
