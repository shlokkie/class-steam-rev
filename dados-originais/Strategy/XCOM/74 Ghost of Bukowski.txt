Never having played the the original XCOMs, I got my newbie butt handed to me more than once during my playthrough of this, and it was great fun even when I kept losing to my own silly mistakes.

The game is fairly straightforward and simple to begin with and naturally dives into more difficult territory later on. I played it without the expansion my first time through, not to get overwhelmed with research, engineering, and options. And for me that was definitely the best thing to do, because the base game has droves of stuff in it to keep you invested.

The hours flew by like so many overconfident Interceptors and pregnant Skyrangers birthing my soon-to-be-sorry-or-promoted Alien Death Squads of dashing, grenade-tossing, laser-wielding soldiers onto the battlefield, again and again. Good times.

If you have a hard time grasping WHY a certain action is better than another, watch the brilliant Youtube videos of Beaglerush playing it on Ironman Impossible. You will still mess up at times, but just watching a few minutes of those videos took the game from being "pretty cool" to being "an absolute joy to play and finish". I'm looking forward to crush (and being crushed by) my alien friends in Enemy Within (and, heaven forbid, The Long War mod).

So, what are you waiting for? Earth needs you, soldier, get ready to flan-...I said flank! Not you, the assault guy, not the...Oh dear, not more enem- Okay, he's gone, rookies are cheap so I don't care, now what do I have left to work wit- ANOTHER ONE!? Okay, I'm getting at least one dude back to my base...

*Teammate panics, shoots second to last guy, then gets shot by an alien himself*

Okay, what did we learn from this? One more try, then. Just one more. You got this.
