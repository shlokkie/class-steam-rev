You know this game did something right when characters that have no backstories and barely even talk die and your first reaction is to feel deep pain. Not because of the gruesome death that a wild Chryssalid can make, not because of the large grenade explosions or the laser beams of a Sectopod, but because an XCom Operative, a squadmate, a friend, will not see the end of the war that got us all together.
