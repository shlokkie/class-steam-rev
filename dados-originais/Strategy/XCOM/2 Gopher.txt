I have always been a big fan of the XCOM franchise since the very first game all those years ago and I have to say that XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a worthy 'reboot' of the series.

The game is an odd mix of strategic base building/management and turn based tactical combat. You will research new weapons, armor and even technologies such as genetic engineering and mech warrior (half man, half machine ... although more like 5% man 95% machine). You will have to capture and interogate the aliens, perform autopsies, and try to understand why the Aliens are here, and how you can stop them.

The visuals are great, although they are a little over the top. You can field warriors clad in pink with bright blue big hair, or you can choose dark comoflaged spec ops type soldiers. It is up to you and has no effect on the game other than to meet your own preferences. You can name you soldiers to make it more personal, and more dramatic when they die.

All round this is a fun game, and with DLC such as the Enemy Within and mods such as Long War this game has a lot of replay value, and potentially could be something you sink hundreds of hours into.
