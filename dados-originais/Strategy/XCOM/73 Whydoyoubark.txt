XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an immersive, tactical, turn-based, resource management oriented and unpredictable strategy game. It's bloody amazing.

PROS:

+ immersion(you care about your soldiers and the missions at hand)
+ squad customization(both the looks and the combat skills)
+ difficulty
+ randomness(the legendary 95% hit chance misses)
+ you are in full control of XCOM project's development

CONS:

- little bugs and glitches here and there, they are more of an annoyance than a flaw

If you are into tactical combat, finding yourself in scenarios in which odds aren't in your favour and the difficulty is fair- instabuy. There's a lot of replayability value thanks to the Ironman mode(the game saves automatically after each turn, what's done is done) and the Second Wave(after your first playthrough, you can customize some of the gameplay elements, tinker a bit to make the game a more personalized experience); moreover, there's a multiplayer component, so you can test your inner tactician when battling live opponents.

Save our planet from the alien invasion and become the saviour of humanity.

XCOM needs you.

"Good luck, Commander."
