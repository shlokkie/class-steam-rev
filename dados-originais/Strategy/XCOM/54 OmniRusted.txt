This game is not hatred personified. It is a computer program. Computer programs cannot feel or think, thus it is not hatred personified. It is a computer program that is programmed to emulate hatred personified. It is emulating it's hatred towards you almost perfectly, and it will show you so. With aliens who hold you down and face-♥♥♥♥ you. That's not even a joke. That's in the game.

If it doesn't hate you enough, get the expansion: Enemy Within, which completely changes the game.

If that doesn't hate you enough, and you think you're tough ♥♥♥♥, Google: Long War. Then go cry. Cry you filthy pathetic little child.

13/10. I am getting a tattoo from this game.
