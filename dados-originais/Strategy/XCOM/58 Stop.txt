I lost one of my most beloved soldiers who had been with me since the first mission.

I went into a rage, then once I calmed down, cried for ten minutes straight.

I haven't played the game since, not out of spite, but because I don't want to get attatched to anyone else who is going to die.

10/10 game provided one of two times in my entire life up to now where I cried at the loss of a character. Just remember this phrase: "Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner." ("The heat" being an alien armada).
