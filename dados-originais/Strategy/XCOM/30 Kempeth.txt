XCOM: Enemy Unknown sucks...


... you in like few other games are capable of!

I have never played the original so I'm not going to judge the game through some nostalgia colored glasses. XCOM: EU is a very tight, lean and challenging game. I commend Firaxis on an excellent difficulty selection where "Easy" really allows for a pretty casual game once you figured out the basics and where a multitude of options and modifiers (Second Wave) allow you to tighten the screw as much as you like.

Combat is tense and tactical, easy to learn but challenging to master. The action cam makes some cool "cutscenes" out of your movements. And the occasional directional hint towards the nearest enemies helps reducing downtime on larger maps.

If you are willing to accept a few simplification over a more exact and detailed simulation you'll be pleased by an elegant design, a great atmosphere and an awesome expansion once you had you fill of the basegame.
