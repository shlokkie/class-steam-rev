You've used up every soldier's turn except for one. You need to take the shot otherwise a gigantic UFO will steamroll several of your hardened veterans.

You move him right into the open to take the shot. This is it, this 40 minute brawl will come to an end one way or the other after this turn. 65% hit accuracy, in the end it has to be this way.

Do you feel lucky, Commander?
