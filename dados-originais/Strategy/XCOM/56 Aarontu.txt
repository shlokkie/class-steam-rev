The original X-COM is one of my favorite games ever, one that I have played through many times. I found the tactics in this game to easier than in the original (especially in the beginning), but the base management side more challenging to figure out, which is good (WAY too easy to make easy millions in the original). I LOVE the "chunky" aesthetics of the game that are a throwback to the original's look, and I've even taken a liking to the change from time units to Final Fantasy Tactics style combat; it really helps the game move along at a nice pace without changing the feel of combat very much. I always used to leave enough time units in the earlier X-COM's to move behind cover and crouch after a shot, so I am pleased that this whole sequence of ducking in and out of cover to fire is built into the game's cover-mechanic. The alien's getting a free move when you see them does not bother me in a thematic sense (they're on "free-move-overwatch" I guess), though it is sometimes immersion-breaking, since you know you cannot be shot at until you "activate" a group of aliens. A bit different feel than the original, due to unseen aliens not shooting, and XCOM soldiers being MUCH harder to kill.

Anyways, I LOVED IT. I haven't encountered the bugs I've seen others complain about, fortunately, and Firaxis has somehow made this game even MORE addictive/compelling than the original, with that same "just one more turn" feel that the Civilization series has. I totally see the complaints about the camera with multi-level maps, though; it's really terrible!

Also, it feels a bit more scripted than what I was expecting, both in the strategic level (3 uninterceptible abduction missions at the same time) and tactical level (aliens don't move until encountered).
