XCOM: Enemy Unknown is the crown jewel of modern designed turn based tactical games.
Here you will not find a true sequel to X-COM, but you will find a good game nonetheless, even if it's in a totally different league. This is more like an evolution of a Final Fantasy Tactics, rather than UFO.
The tactical gameplay and the strategic layer are interlinked and form a choesive whole. The more mission you win, the more goods you will bring home and use to beef up your squad, until you win against the alien menace. The Enemy Within Expansion adds more stuff and goodies to research and to spend your resources on, making for a more varied gameplay and providing the player with more choices to make, both in the strategic layer and in the tactical layer.
The permadeath that permeates the whole experience, makes this a game that punish you for bad decisions, from start to finish. It's higly reccomended to play this in 'Iron Man' mode, which is a mode where manual saving is not possible and the game autosaves after each action, increasing a lot the tension.
The game also offers nice replayability options, thanks to possible different squad layouts, a big numebr of maps and the 'second wave options', modifiers that change the behaviour of many of the game mechanics, avalaible for a second, third and more runs.
The game suffers from an inverse difficulty curve, where the lategame is much easier than your early game, and the Enemy Within expansion makes this worse. The descreased difficulty and teh lack of major events make the late game a bit of a slog.
I suggest playing EW on a higher difficulty than your average EU playthrough to compensate. The game also has some bugs here and there, even if in EW and with the latest patch, their number should be reduced.
All things being said, this game is a must buy for gamers looking for a bit of turn based combat, which is so rare to find nowdays.
