Awesome! If you include the Longwar Mod. Good without it. Be warned ... the long war mod is brutal, your favorite characters will die, but the anxiety/reward factor is fantastic! Said anxiety only allows me to play in 2-3 hour spurts then my mind simply must rest.. :) More of a lifestyle than a game.

Edit: Another huge must have for this game are the voice packs from MJpoland and others. You get the voices from Marcus, Coltrain, Baird, Dom, Carmine, etc. from GOW in one pack, Deadpool in another pack, plus COD voices in another and there are even more. I use all of them. trust me, once you install these into the default content ini. you will never play without them again.
