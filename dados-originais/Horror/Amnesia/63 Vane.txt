Made right to be done right.
"Best Survival Horror Indie Game"
Amnesia - The Dark Descent is the kind of survival horror game that must be done right. By that I mean not playing it surrounded with natural and/or artificial light and plenty of people around who may or may not have played this before. This is the kind of title that asks for you to be alone in the dark with stereo headphones on. This is how you properly set the gamma the first time you play the game. You have to properly set the mood in order for you to get the best possible horror experience out of Amnesia - The Dark Descent.

Overall: Amnesia the Dark Descent is an enjoyable title with a refreshing twist on the survival horror genre. But as stated the re-playability is limited, but is at least worth the 20 bucks just so as long you enjoy this type of experience. Other than that: Good job Frictional Game!
