★★★★☆ - "Worth your time, give it a bash"

PROS:
- The enemy in this game is monstrous, everything about it is terrifying.
- An interesting story told through minimal cut scenes and notes.
- Creepy environments which you can roam around, each very atmospheric with superb lighting and design.
- Restrictive gameplay means you interact only with objects, this adds to the tension as you can't fight back but only run and hide.
- Amnesia is just one big puzzle game, one that doesn't hold your hand and is very challenging. You learn by dying and by reading, listening and experimenting with objects.

CONS:
- As you can only interact with objects I would have liked to had seen more of them, some rooms feel repetitive and if they were to be more dense it could have only added more character.
- A tiny complaint here are the loading screens, as you enter certain areas there are loading screens, they are overly long but as you play more there become more. On a positive note it doesn't distract too much away from immersion as its all just one big place too explore.

VERDICT?
A very tense experience, not for the feint hearted nor the impatient but a rewarding and intriguing game.
