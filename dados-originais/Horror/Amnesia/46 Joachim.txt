Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a blend of adventure game elements such as exploration and physic based puzzles in a horror themed environment. They complement each other well, as the places you wander through get gradually more terrifying, the fairly unconvoluted riddles help you ease the tension that can become almost unbearable at times. This is where this game shines, the pace is skillfully mastered, even if you have difficulties persisting in horror games you might very well finish this one. The design is tighly knot around exploration, lightening candles and torches to ward off the darkness, finding the scattered pieces of the story and a death mechanic inconsequential to your progress. The game manages to fill you both with a sense of curiosity as you descent further into the abyss to unravel its mysteries, and a sense of dread to what awaits you in its darkest recesses. You won't be disappointed by its climax.

Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience, yet a highly unpleasant one, reaching that difficult balance each horror game aims to find. It lasts 7 to 8 hours, and there is the possibility to play custom stories, which I might review here as I go through them.
