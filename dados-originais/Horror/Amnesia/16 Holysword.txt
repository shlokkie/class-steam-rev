1) Turn off the lights
2) Get good stereo headset
3) Put on a diaper
4) Immerse yourself and play the game

You're stranded in a deserted (you wish) castle, trying to figure out who you are, following notes that you left to yourself. In those notes, you urge yourself to descend deeper and deeper into the castle, and while you do so, you learn the horrible truth of what is going on... slowly... slowly learn... equipped with an oil lamp and nothing more. The atmosphere is very creepy, and you have to care for your physical and mental health during the whole game. If you run out of light, you run out of sanity.

There are many puzzles in the game to be solved, collecting objects spread around to unlock a door, and so on. They would be silly in a regular setting, but here you think "Oh horror, do I have to go AGAIN in that dark, dark, dark room?!?!" There are NO JUMP SCARES. You can usually "feel the horror coming" (and after coming; refer to item 3) and then you look... there it is... or nope, there is nothing. Or wait, there is. What was that noise? Where was that? Behind me? No, that things wasn't there before. DAMMIT I'M RUNNING OUT OF OIL IN MY LAMP!

This game does a great job at making the player afraid of exploring some areas, just because you learn it could mean "trouble". Best horror game on Steam I have found so far. Unfortunately, there are no achievements.
