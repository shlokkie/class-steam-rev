The original indie horror game that started it all. If you are in need of a good scare with an incredibly creepy setting, and actual storyline, this is the game for you. I cannot stress enough how fantastically horrifying it is. This is mostly done through the constant needs to push forward to avoid the darkness chasing you, but the knowledge that ahead lies horrible monsters. You're sort of stuck in the middle and it leaves you with a sense of helplessness that I've never experienced before.
