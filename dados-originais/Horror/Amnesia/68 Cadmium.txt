*Game was completed off-Steam*

So, Amnesia took me a hell of a long time to complete, one because I did a playthrough of it, but two because it was so genuinely terrifying I really didn't want to play it.

In an industry where "shock" scares are relied upon for primary fear tactics, Amnesia changes the game by relying purely on ambience and creeping, gnawing delirium.

If you like horror, you'll like it. If you don't, you really wont.
