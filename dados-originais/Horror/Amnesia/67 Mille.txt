You play as a character named Daniel. Basically, you wake up and discover that you drank something to make yourself purposely forget everything and where you are. You've left yourself a note saying you have to kill this guy named Alexander. You explore the castle, solve puzzles, and avoid monsters.
You have no weapons, no possible way to kill the monsters. All you have is an oil lamp. In darkness you'll be tripping and loose your mind slightly, but the monsters can see you in the light... Make sure to keep your sanity...
