I had never experianced immersion until I had played this game. I had always sat in front of the screen as events unfolded in front of me. This game was different. I didn't just play the game, I WAS Danial. I felt the fear. I felt the confusion. I felt Amnesia. Everything that happened in this game, I felt like I had done. It struck me to the core. It gave me nightmares. It made me question my own humanity. How can a human being be so terrible I asked myself. Play this game to find out!
