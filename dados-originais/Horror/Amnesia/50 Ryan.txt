I played like an hour, the whole hour I moved maybe down a hall at most... Saw a monster, it chased me, I crapped my pants and ran from the PC fo' real. My nerves cannot take this game, It's way to freaky and I think it's mainly because you just can't fight back. If you want a scary game that will get your heart racing and possibly you racing out of your house screaming, then get Amnesia!
