Amnesia: Dark Descent= Scary game
Scary game= Lots of quitting
Lots of quitting= Well, you get it


Amnesia is fun and scary game. You play as person who can only carry lantern but no guns (noob), so you can't kill.
Game have lots of puzzles; some of them are easy and some of them are hard.

Of course, there's monsters (gasp). Monsters are f*cking scary! (And that prison, heh)
