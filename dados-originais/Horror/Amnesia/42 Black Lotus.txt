Starting off.. Well to find a really good horror game is one of the rarest things these days, but "Amnesia: The Dark Descent" hit the marks and goes beyond all my expectations.

Turn off your lights, put on some headphones and solve some amazing puzzles or get scared to death by this awesome game, if youâ€™re still sane after playing this, maybe you never were sane to begin with^^

You will never know if the monsters are right behind you!
