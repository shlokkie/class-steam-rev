9 Spooky Scary Skeletons out of 10

+ great atmosphere
+ really immersive
+ not being able to fight back makes you feel helpless
+ the story was kind of meh in my opinion, although the fact that your character learns the story and his memories with you is neat
+ you can find some really awesome custom stories for it! (and some that are so bad that they are good again)


- the only thing I disliked is the fact that enemies tend to disappear after you get killed, removing any challenge from that particular encounter

If you are unsure whether to buy it or not, I'd recommend to watch the beginning of a Let's Play or walkthrough to get a better understanding of the game.
