-Recipe for playing this game-

Ingredients:
- 1 cozy blanket (2 is also good)
- 1 computer or laptop
- 1 installed Amnesia game
- 2 nice chairs
- 1 Dark room
- 1 willing boyfriend who has experience with the game
- 1 pillow or stuffed animal to hug (or the arm of the boyfriend, but he might disagree about that when he got puncture wounds from your nails after the first jumpscare)

Directions:

1. Start up the computer, it may take a while depending on how good your system is. Use the startup time to go on a treasure hunt for the other ingredients. Also make sure that the room is dark enough.

2. Persuade your boyfriend to play Amnesia. It could be that he declines, if so, capture him with a Pok√©ball.

3. Wrap yourself and the boyfriend in a blanket and sit in the chairs in front of the Computer.

4. Now it's safe to start Amnesia, make sure you keep your distance.

5. Let the boyfriend play it, specially when he is experienced with the game, just sit back and ask silly questions which he probably already gave the answer to but you were too spooked to listen.

6. Enjoy!
