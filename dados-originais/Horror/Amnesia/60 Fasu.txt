I must say, this game is REALLY scary. And I mean it. I remember when this game came and peolple were like: "This is too scary, I can't play it more than couple of minutes" or "I'm gonna never play this game again". I've been playing the orginal story trough and before it I had watched many gameplays and walktrhougs from it. Even after them I was really afraid when I played it. I knowed well enough where monsters appears, but nevertheless they scared me.
The basic idea of the game is survive in dark castle and escape from monsters. You can't fight to monsters, you can only escape or hide. You must also collect the pages of your diary, because you haven't memories from past. Them tell you about the story. The game isn't just running and hiding. There's also many puzzles what give such good a change.
It's not just scare because of terrible and ugly monsters (sometimes it's even quite funny to play with them), the real horror is made by absolutely great atmosphere. And what make this atmosphere, they are sounds and musics.
Firstly I must praise musics. From peaceful and mystical ambiences to terrible and oppressive themes. In different places you hear variable musics and also every events and monsters have it's own themes.
The storytelling is made by foundable diary pages and sounds what you here in flashbacks. I'm such glad that there isn't very much violence in the game, but the sounds you sometimes hear in the flashbacks will be disturbing. A whole sound of world is very well carry out. Also the great story and scare places create good atmosphere.
Bad in this game is sometimes quite bad bugs and shortness, but you can download other palyers enlargements from net.
Buy this game, it's great!
