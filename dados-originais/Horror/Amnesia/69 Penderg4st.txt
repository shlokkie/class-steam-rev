I played Amnesia for 11 hours and i enjoyed every single moment of this game. It's full of dark places, your light is limited, and there are monsters around you, which you can only free from. The lack of light makes you feel scared and insecure, expecially for your "brain health": if there's no sufficient light or if you are looking to a monster for too much time, the brain health will go down and strange visions and effects will appear on the screen. I think it's one of the best aspects of this game. The sound has a great quality as same, making you feel inside the game, and there are many puzzles and hard parts that will keep your mind working for long time. I advice for sure this game to the horror fans, and i advice to the others to try it out, cause it really deserves a lot.
