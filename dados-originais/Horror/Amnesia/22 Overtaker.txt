Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first person survival horror game.
The player takes the role of Daniel, who awakens in the darkened halls of Brennenburg Castle and as you start the game your memory is gone. Daniel is trying to discover hints about his past through reading notes that he apparently left for himself and searching through old diary entries and random scraps of paper. Hints are also provided by flashbacks that regularly pop up out of nowhere.
In Amnesia there are no weapons. The only assistance you get is an oil lamp, some matches and if prefered the hints the game gives you. Also a nice and fearsome feature is your insanity. As you make your progress through the game you have to keep an eye on your sanity. If a monster gets close or you stay in the dark for too long, your character gets insane. The game also features some nice puzzles.
Most part of the game takes place in dark areas or with some small lighting effects. The effects when your vision is blurred are nicely done.
The sound is one of the games greatest aspects. The soundtrack ranges from ambient tunes to haunting sound effects like moaning or wind breezes. Or you hear footsteps and then suddenly some cockroaches are under your feet.
Amnesia is a perfect horror game to play in the dark, alone and with headphones.
If you are a fan of the horror genre you should buy this game.
