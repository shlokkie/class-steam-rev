Updated after playing Act 2

PROS
- Nice atmosphere
- Based on Indoesian myths
- Puzzles
- SnK reference
- Sound and music works well
- Well timed jump scares
- Ghosts have backstories
- Act 2 certainally made the game a whole lot better!

CONS
- Act 1 was fairly short
- Graphics are okay

Overall
I would recommend this if you enjoyed playing any of the Fatal Frame series though Dreadout doesn't match it, it will be closer than any other game would be unless they decide to make a Fatal Frame port for pc :)

After recently playing Act 2 I can highly recommend this game as it was alot more intense than Act 1. I do hope that they plan on continuing this or perhaps other games with this playstyle.
