Okay so in the immediate beginning of the game , where the car stops at the bridge; 

You can turn around and walk the other way , up the road the car came from.

I do not reccomend this , i can safely say that 1,5 hours of walking that path will lead you to nothing but trees and more road.

I will keep you updated whether or not i will find something after 2 hours.


So yeah great graphics on the road , good trees
Apart from a few slight left and or right turns the road didn't differ very much , but i guess i'll take it.

Overall , as much as i've seen from this game...

I give it 9 deserted - never ending roads out of 10
