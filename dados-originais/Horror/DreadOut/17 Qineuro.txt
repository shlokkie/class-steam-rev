I went in with a head full of high hopes. Unfortunately, the few decent ideas this game has are ruined by completely miserable gameplay and design. Expect bugs, enemies that will stunlock you to death, a system that punishes the player for dying by making them wait arbitrary, incrementally-increasing amounts of time to respawn, obtuse, illogical puzzles, poor voice acting and translation work, dated graphics, stiff, absurd character animation, directionless pixel hunting, paths that continue infinitely instead of dead-ending...

About that death system? When your character dies, you get to engage in the delightful minigame of running in a straight line towards a respawn point. The first time you die, the jog takes about 15 seconds. With each death the run becomes longer and longer. As soon as you die, the game autosaves and checkpoints you, so there's no way of avoiding this sequence. By the time I quit out to write this review, I counted the tedious errand taking upwards of a minute. The developers brag about this mechanic in the in-game manual.

I don't like this game. It's a shame, because there's some genuinely cool imagery and a handful of good scares, but the experience of playing it is nothing but frustrating. Put your money towards one of the many other more polished and enjoyable horror games on Steam.
