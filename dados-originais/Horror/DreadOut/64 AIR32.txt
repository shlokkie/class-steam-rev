The best horror game i ever played. Well, this is the only horror game i've played in my life whatsoever lel. 

‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍A bunch of students and their teacher are travelling for vacation. They discover a deserted city and decide to check what's going on there. They notice a school and take decision to get in. Here the nightmare begins. Ira becomes possessed and Linda gets separated from the group for some reason (i didn't get it). You play as one of the students, the only "weapon" you can use is a phone you can see and kill ghosts with. Now you need to find your mates and get out of the school and city, but that's not as easy as it sounds.
‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍This pretty good Indonesian atmospheric game inspired by Fatal Frame will scare the dickens out of you. This creepy game with its excellent atmosphere won't let you relax for a moment, you had better play it using headphones and, of course, with no light. The lack of the game is graphics and performance. Even on highest settings the graphics leaves a lot to be desired but it is not a big deal, i'm ok with this. The problem is the poor performance, with such a graphics fps drops to 20 often enough and 10-15 occasionally. There are several puzzles in the game but they ain't difficult at all. 


PS: First of all, play the demo.

PPS: After you finish the game listen to this song "Mocca – Lucky Me" you might heard in act 1. Don't know why, but this song causes some keen feelings after the game. 

PPPS: F*CK THOSE UPDATED OBJECTIVES!
