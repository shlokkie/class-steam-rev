This game isn't the worst horror game I've ever played...but it's not the best either. This game isn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. If you are considering buying this game because you think it looks like Fatal Frame, then you should read my review first. 

This game has less to do with encountering ghosts and more to do with solving difficult puzzles. Don't get me wrong...I love puzzles! I wouldn't have a problem with a few short puzzles in a horror game. It becomes a problem when I spend so much time trying to solve puzzles that I'm no longer being scared by the game. Instead, I end up being frustrated. 

Also, the game lacks balance. The first ghost you encounter is a violent giant pig that apparently CAN'T BE KILLED! Why is this the first creature I encounter? Why not start with a very basic enemy to help you get a hang of the controls? I don't know! Makes no sense. Also, the first boss you encounter is nearly impossible. You fight a ghost with scissors in a small space that requires you to have impossible reflexes in order to even have a chance at victory.

At the end of the day, this game isn't fun or scarry, but frustrating. I'm hoping that the developers take all these things into consideration before they release Act 2.
