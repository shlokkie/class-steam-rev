I personally enjoyed this game, although it was short (Probably because it was only act 1). It had good aspects to it. 
-The atmosphere was very creepy
-The sounds and music in this game make you feel uneasy
-The ghost in the upper right wing scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me
-Feels like a mix of silent hill and fatal frame
The not so good stuff about it:
-Graphics are meh
-Story is also pretty meh (so far)
Final Rating: 9/10 would throw headphones again (Thanks Upper Right wing ghost)
Can't wait for part 2!
