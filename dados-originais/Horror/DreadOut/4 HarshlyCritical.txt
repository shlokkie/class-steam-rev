I haven't felt compelled to write a review in a while, but I think this game deserves one considering how quickly I've seen some people write it off. (I include myself in that category)

After completing Act 2, I think this is a rather charming game with some really solid ideas, if finicky execution. The ghost design is excellent, and there are some truly impressive individual sections. One that stands out in particular is an actual dialogue sequence with one of the ghosts.

The game is weighed down in some spots by awkward pacing, poor conveyance and goofy NPC interactions. If you can muscle through those, you'll find a pretty solid indie horror game with a creative style that sets it apart from the standard first-person "roam through dark hallways" genericity of many of its peers.

It's quirky, it's fun, and surprisingly frightening. The final boss fight is a trippy, delightful end that wraps up the game very well.

DreadOut has its flaws, but overall this is one of the few modern horror games I would call "unique." It's worth checking out solely for some of the cool sections in the second half of Act 2. Recommended!
