Most of what I said below still applies, but after seeing how short the game was, how awkward the game's overall control scheme is, and how confusing and nonexistent the plot/character development is, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have a diverse taste in survival horror games or who aren't enormous Fatal Frame buffs.. My voice over friends being on this project made my first impression a bit biased, and as a longtime gamer I feel like this game was coded somewhat poorly and doesn't hold up well. Just kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

---------------------

Solid game. The first enemy I saw (about 15 minutes in) literally had me breathless and scared for my life, and most horror games these days don't do it for me.

The interesting thing is, I'm a voice-actor, and all my voice-acting friends provide voices for the main cast of characters. They're all experienced professionals and they give the game a believable atmosphere, with crystal-clear audio quality not commonly found in indie games.

The only cons I can say so far are the really low-resolution textures (mostly in daylight outside, which is a brief experience) and the very jerky/clunky character animations make you realize just how indie/low-budget the game is. Some characters seem to moonwalk a little bit while the cutscene animations are really jerky and twitchy. It lends itself REALLY well to the scary parts when enemies are twitching and convulsing, but when two girls are playing patty-cake in the beginning it looks super bizarre for some reason.

If you ever get stuck like I did (the game throws you in with literally ZERO tutorials) there's a 'How to Play' section at the title screen. It shows you the first enemy you deal with, and it can't be defeated, and it suggests that you need an item to defeat it. I think that's kinda cool, since tutorials ruin the atmosphere and it feels better to search for the answer.
