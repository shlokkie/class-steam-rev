I don't write many reviews but I thought i would with this game. I think Dreadout is a nice well made and well spooked game. A few jump scares, a lot of ghosts and a handy dandy way to illiminate them. The atmosphere is very creepy. Just what I expect from a horror game. Some of the boss fights are a bit hard, but doable, some with a lot more difficulty than others. The story is good. The voice actors do a great job. I would definatly recommend this game to any die hard horror game fan, or any one that just wants a scary atmosphere and a little bit of battle. Really good game.
