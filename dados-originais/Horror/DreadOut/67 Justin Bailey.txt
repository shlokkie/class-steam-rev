+Decent presentation
+Solid mechanics
+Interesting lore

-Poor graphic performance (Unity engine...)
-Flawed level design
-Combat is very simple
-Cringe worthy voice acting
-Most scares are through cutscenes that botch the tension
-Very boring overall

3/10 - Bad
I'd recommend this to people who get scared very easily or those wanting to make Let's Plays.
But the technical isses stand out so much that I can't get past them.
