I thought this would have been scarier. Its mostly just pop out scares. I do like some of the interesting info about the creatures once you look at their bio. The school is confusing at first because everything looks alike. Once you run around for awhile you kinda get it. Worth playing, its short..but i've played shorter. 7/10
