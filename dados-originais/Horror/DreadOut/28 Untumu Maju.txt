OK here I go:

Dreadout is the first Indonesian game I know that made it to Steam, so this is a matter of national pride, but I will try as much as I can to be objective with the review.

Being a game that comes out of Indiegogo crowdfunding and done in Unity I know there are limitations that the studio cannot cross. Graphics wise it is on par with many PS2 games of the mid 2000s era, with very simple texturing method, animation is also a bit weird at times.

On the positive side: Character design and AI is very well done. I haven't found any critical bugs that would ruin the gameplay. Ghost design is spot on when it goes for the creepiness factor. But what I would give 5/5 stars is the general atmosphere of the game. This game does not rely on cheap jumpscares but more of an unpleasant sense of presence, in that you know there are ghosts and supernatural beings out there to get you and you must get through them to proceed with the story (that is what Dread is supposed to mean I think). Sound effect and music is amazing. It feels like every single step that you make is bringing you closer to another ghost. Gameplay wise some of the ghosts are actually quite challenging to defeat.

Other: If you are not familiar with Indonesian culture you will see many things that are culturally relevant to Indonesians which are subtle but noticeable (sort of an inside joke for me). 

Cannot wait for Act 2! and maybe more acts to come!
