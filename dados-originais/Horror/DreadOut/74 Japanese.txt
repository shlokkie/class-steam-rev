My opinion is based on act 1 which is the only act released atm (around 17.05.2014).

First of all what I don't like.
- Either I'm stupid or there is little to no logical explanation or hinting about what object you need to collect and why them specifically. You will get them relatively easy if you just go on explore areas, but if you go on just only on logic - kinda weird.
- Little bit weird animation at places

What I like
- Amazing atmosphere
- Magnificent atmosphere!
- Marvellous build up to everything!
- Bunch of great details in the city (no idea what was the point of medals though)
- Interesting ideas for ghosts
- Night dome right!

What hopefully will be patched
- Maybe some notes/story bits will be added to sorta explain logic little bit more.
- Gamepad controls are... weird. In the end I picked up KB and M.

P.S. I really hope for sequel after act 2. Not necessary with same characters (we don't know how they end up yet), but maybe some story about this city or some specific persons in the city.
