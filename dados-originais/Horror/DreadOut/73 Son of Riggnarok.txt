I'm not gonna say anything harsh it is an indie game afterall, But they need to make it use less resources I mean It takes sometimes about 9 seconds to press shift tab and check your steam stuff, While playing my main menu vanished I couldn't quit the game, but I was able to check my files and photos ect. Only way to quit was to alt tab than nothing was loading I had to control alt delete to close it. And there is no invert option :C But other than those annoyances the game is great! Totally gonna recommend this game to friends. An option to play the game in the original language and have English subtitles would be nice also.
