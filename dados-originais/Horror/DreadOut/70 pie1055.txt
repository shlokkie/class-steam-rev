It's hard to write a review for this game. On the one hand, it has great atmosphere and loads of spooky scary stuff and I really enjoy playing it. However, it's currently unfinished.

All in all this game is worth it if you can manage waiting for the new content to come out because at least Act II will be a free update to the game. Until then you're left in the dark about Lynda's future.
