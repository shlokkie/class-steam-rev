I finally did all the Acts Dreadout had to offer so now I want to share my thoughts on what the game delivered, what it lacked & what could've been added. 

SPOILERS ARE COMING BEWARE

Alright just to get the negatives out of the way the story is one of those hit & miss kinds (It's also very vague) because it isn't that interesting to me, there was no connection with the other NPCs in the game to care about, there are some bugs in Act 2 that sort of annoy me, Linda needs to attend more gym class because she runs too slow & I think that's all the cons that I can think of that ruin the game for me so now we'll go to the good part.

The game really shines with the gameplay because it's focused on delivering ghosts that are talked about in indonesian culture & also heavily influenced by the Fatal Frame games (Maybe a bit of silent hill because of some of the ghosts) with some chilling music composed with all sorts of instruments to really give you some goosebumps while your hunting for ghosts with your cellphone & camera. Each ghost also has some lore behind them including some disturbing ones like the scissor phantom for example (Here's his story http://dreadout.wikia.com/wiki/Scissor_Phantom give it a read) & also the achievements have a few references (Also a few achievements with hashtags & pop culture) like for example the Attack On Titan achievement is a reference to the post apocalyptic anime that everyone craves about including me (Here's the IMDB page about the show http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/ in case I sparked some curiosity for people that never heard about it). The game is also set in an semi open world so there is a lot to explore but it's more difficult to adventure at night, the options menu is ok, the game can also be played with controller & if you really want a hardcore experience turn off all the hints in the options menu.

The only thing I wish the game had was a better connection with the other NPCs but there's other suggestions you can add in this forum here http://steamcommunity.com/app/269790/discussions/0/558755530214691567/ because the devs are listening & I like game devs that respect their consumers but overall the game has been cleaned up from past issues so that's a plus. I think that's all I have to say about this game & if you have anything to say about this review leave feedback it helps me a lot.
