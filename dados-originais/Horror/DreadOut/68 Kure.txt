I'll start off with the one really big issue with the game, the textures look really outdated. This could pass as an older gamecube or original Xbox title, but for $15 this is a something that can be overlooked. Though initially it does seem like it will get in the way of immersion, once the game gets started and sets its dark tone, you'll be able to look passed it.
The atmosphere in this game is done really well, the music and tone are perfect for what a horror title should be. This definitely brings back feelings of classic old school horror.

The dialog and animations are a bit funny, but in the good way. Think kind of like the original resident evil way. Something I found charming really, the kind of bad that's really good and makes you enjoy the game!

This is Digital Happiness' first real title, and it shows. That being said, they did a really good job as far as being able to provide a new horror game in to the mix. There's a lot of potential for this franchise to grow, and for only $15, it's worth a try, especially if you're in to the classic horror games.
This is also the first Indonesian game to hit steam, and Indonesia is still growing as far as its games development market is concerned. When you take that in to account, they did pretty damn well with this game, and I hope they;re successful enough to continue making more games and being able to build on what they've learned with more funding and experience.
