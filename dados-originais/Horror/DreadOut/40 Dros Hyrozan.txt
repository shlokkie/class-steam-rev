Great Premise, Terrible design. This game is been in a streak of bad horror games Ive been suckered into buying lately based on an awesome idea only to have it brutally murdered by terrible game design. Lets start at the top, the game looks and feels pretty cheap(which its mainly because its an indie studio) but the dialogue is just plain terrible. The game gives you VERY shoddy direction( Im not asking you to hold my hand but when I have to go and google my way out of a problem because the objective literally has nothing to do with what you're doing then we have a major problem.), its very bland and has boss fights that makes you hate the game because they are just plain unfair, adding to the fact that everytime you die you get penalized by having to spirit walk for X amount of minutes that increases each time you die making it a lesson in fultility,frustraton and joylessness. Overall avoid this game like the plague, if a dev refuses to fix major problems dont give them your money.
