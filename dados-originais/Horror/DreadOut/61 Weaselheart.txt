Dreadout truly is a survival horror. Borrowing from Indonesian folklore, it manages to create one of the most paralizying scary games in years. You play as Linda, a highschool student on a roadtrip with her classmates and teacher, Soon they find a road block and have to continue on foot, traversing a desolate town, and stopping at an abandoned school (cause horror game characters are suicidal and have a death wish).

But before i fully praise the game, I have to warn EVERYONE about the issues this game has, which are several and MASSIVE.

-Gamepad controls are ♥♥♥ and can't be rebinded, so you are better of playing with mouse and keyboard, butthe mouse has terrible acceleration that you will never get used to, making it frustrating, and indirectly scarier. All the character movement and actions are clumsier than your usual survival horror. It´ll get you mad at some points, and is not good to be too mad to even be scared.

-Texture quality is on the VERY low end, and pop in is almost as scary as some ghosts, since they will appear right infront of your feet. 

-Models and graphics in general look worse tha the average ps2 title, is not a massive complain for me, but is very striking at first, and needs some time to get used to...

-Story: Characters are dumb as hell, the story isnt even there, is just a platform to make you face these horrors, the end. On the bright side, the dialogue is so corny and bad, you will be glad that you spend most of the game completely alone.

So now lets list what i consider great in this game.

-Atmosphere: Lets just say, you are better off playing this game with brown pants, cause the simple act of walking is already a challenge when the enviroments looks so eerie and creepy. Also, the enviroments have this samey maze look. like older Silent HIll titles, where all rooms would look almost similar, making it difficult to draw an mental map, and raising the stress bar even higher. You´ll have a flashlight, which barely illuminates, and totally works.

-Sound: Great use of sound effects and music, is hardly ever strartling, but always tense and haunting in the best posible sense, musical cues will evoke a feeling of dread that will follow you though most of the game. 

-Ghosts: won't even call them enemies, even if they are out to kill you, but they are so amazing, they deserve to be called for what they are...This game not only has some of the best ghosts i´ve seen in games, but has their actual lore, and they don't get the mob treatment, each ghost is unique, and doesnt repeat, meaning, you wont be facing hordes of them (in 1 fight you do), instead, encounters will be more self contained and memorable for this graceful design choice. I really loved the ghosts in this game, so much, that ater playing, i find myself researching about them, just to learn more about them.

-Puzzles: Good and Bad. Bad at first cause they aren't you usual "pull x levers in a certain order" type of puzzles...They involve more what you see as a player, and make of the enviroment, is more about observation (almost like antichamber at times) than the more conventional puzzle solving (silent hill, RE, amnesia, etc).

In an ocean of horror games, all presented as luxury ships (Evil Within, Alien Isolation, Soma, Outlast, etc), Dreadout is a rackety wooden boat, the difference, this crappy boat is the truly haunted one.

Other than that, i´m really looking forward to future horror works from this studio (Digital Hapiness), a small indonesian indie dev that has really left an impression in the industy with their first work (this game).

And still, i know the average consumer is too used to triple A graphcis and handholding(and being honest, better design in general), that is why I hesitate to recommend dreadout for full price, but it its on sale, you love horror, and can endure dodgy design, this is a game you will probably appreciate.
