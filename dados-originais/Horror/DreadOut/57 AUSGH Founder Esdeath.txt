Definately worth playing through! At this current time only Act1 out of Act2 is available and Act2 will be released in the future as a free update if you have a copy of DreadOut in the first place. For what it's worth to me it reminded me a lot of the old Silent Hills like Silent Hill 2 especially. I fully enjoyed this game and had quite a few really good scares as it kept me on edge a lot of the time. I had to refer once or twice elsewhere as I got stuck; however the 1st Act was very enjoyable so I cannot wait for the 2nd Act to conclude the game. Good music, some interesting and unique opponents with only your camera ready on your smartphone as your only means of defence!. Once Act2 has been released and I have played it I will add to this review but so far it is a very good one considering there is still half of the game yet to go. Thumbs up xD
