Nice game!
The game reminds a lot to the good old horror games.
Graphically is very weak, but have enough quality to be scary and perfectly enjoyable.
The puzzles are great and sometimes very hard to solve.
Unfortunately, the game is too SHORT. I am not sure whether the Act 2 will have the same length or will be longer. In case of having the same length, it's a very bad point. The game only have a couple of hours so with Act 2 would be 4 or 5 as much. I hope the developers takes this into consideration at time to release the Act 2 since the Act 1 is too short. Also looking forward for the free roaming mode. It may be interesting but still, the game needs a longer story asides of this extra mode.
Right now, the game is kinda "expensive" due the short duration but if you are a lover of horror and survival games then is worth it.
