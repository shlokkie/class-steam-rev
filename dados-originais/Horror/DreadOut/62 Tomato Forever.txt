Oldschool horror game without any weapons, only camera.
And Indonesian style horror and ghost.
And Fatal Frame like.

And what else?
Nothing Beats This horror game in my opinion, it's really scares me.
The jumpscare make your heart feels pumped up.

For Indonesian game this is really good game for me.
Because I have never seen Indonesia game as good as this game.
I can't wait for the DLC to come out, and it's free-roam.

Go get this game, trust me you'll never regret it.
