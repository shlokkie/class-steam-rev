This is a good game , it got a good old school scare and pay full respect to it's source materials. However it's still a flawed game.

When you "died" too many times in the game, you are sent to "limbo" and have to make your way out to continue the game however the amount of distance that you have to walk everytime you dies, increases. This is frustating as hell as I died alot of times because I was clueless on what to do or I didn't know the ghost weakness. I have to walk about 2minutes+ in the limbo everytime i die and the game became stale to me. 

How about removing this whole system and just replace it with a simple "Continue?" screen?

The boss fight with the scissors ghost is another flawed boss fight, I am not saying the boss is hard to defeat but when the boss was about to die, the boss suddenly goes into full steroid mode and when the boss hit you once, you are practically dead. Yes, you can still escape but trust me, it's hard as hell. How about making the boss stop for every 5 seconds when it's on steroid mode? So you can catch your breath and get a proper angle/view to attack the boss. Honestly this is the part where I died too many times that I have to walk 2 minutes in the limbo and fight the boss again and die again. 

Other than that, I am waiting for ACT 2. 
Good game for an indonesian company ! 8/10 !
