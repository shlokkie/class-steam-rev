Thanks to Digital Happiness...
Good old horror games classics are back!!
Immersion, Atmosphere, Fear, a 3rd person perspective, a good old light for the road 
(mobile in this case) and a crazy, scary frekin' weird storyline...
DreadOut delivers all that, mixed with eerie haunted sounds and frightening soudtrack.

Puzzles are also a great addition to this "Back to Old School" horror game.
For a game i thought at 1st, would be so so, it turns out that DreadOut is frekin' good!
Horror lovers, you miss good old titles and old school feelings 
from horror games you had back then?
You loved traditional classics like Fatal Frame series or Silent Hill?
Search no more! This title is for you! And the good news is...Its a NEW game!

The road is blocked ahead... On the horizon, an old abandoned town...
Almost frozen in time...Something is terribly wrong here...
Take some pictures here and there...Walk with your comrades...
You can only hear the wind... And your nightmare begins...

For all the horror games devs out there?
Take a good look at what is DreadOut...and learn!
10/10! In my top 5 horror games of all time!
