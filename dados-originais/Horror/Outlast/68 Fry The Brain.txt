This is one of those games, that you are afraid to play, but once you start delving deeper into the Asylum, you cannot help but continue your adventure through the blood soaked halls of insanity and despair, desperately trying to discover the answers to a story that, in all actuallity, should not be discovered. Perhaps it is best to pass on this title, it will chill you to the bone, because there is some truth to the story, and some stories are better left untold.

Outlast is a good rendition of the final days of humanity, when all fantasy is made reality, and much of the world as we know it today, will be transformed by the elements of War, Chaos, & Destruction. Madness will be prevalent in those last days that lurk just beyond our sight, and around that...proverbial... corner.
