Review: Just one word: Insane. It's amazing game, I did not find error, bug, nothing problem(s). Nice graphics, elaborated story, exciting and sometimes pleasant music, beautiful effects. 
And yes, I say this, that horror game, the drama is constantly present. Red Barrels ... long ago (as I remember it) created games on Nokia's Symbian system.
I never even gave 10 points in any game. 
So congratulations to this pair of individual men: 10/10. Absolutely recommend it to everyone (18+).
