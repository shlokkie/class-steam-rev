a scary and really tense horror game, there is no combat here so you have to run and hide all the time, which makes it even scarier. tense atmosphere, great story and amazing creepy sounds ( jump scares included too) that adds a lot to the experience. it takes around 5 hours to finish the main game.

so is it worthy of a purchase ? i bet my smelly brown pants it is.

Edit: i have just finished the WhistleBlower DLC, the gameplay is pretty much the same as the main game, but it adds a lot to the story as a prequel and it explains what happens after the ending of the main story. highly recommended for sure.
