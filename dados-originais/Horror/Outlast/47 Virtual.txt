Outlast gives the player the feeling that they're in constant danger of death throughout the entire game. Enemies do massive amounts of damage on anything other than Normal difficulty and on Insane difficulty, they will instantly kill you. My heart rate didn't go down for over 3 hours while I was playing this on Insane difficulty and I'm walking away from this game shaking. I would absolutely recommend this game if you don't any have heart problems and are interested in an extremely stressful experience.
