Even though the past few years have brought along a number of horror titles that haven't really been up to par, Outlast is a survival-horror experience that shines through.

It's been stated previously that Outlast isn't the most innovative or creative work available, and although that statement rings true on a cetain number of levels, it's definitely a title to consider and invest in, especially if you're a horror-junkie who's looking for some more nightmare fuel.

Outlast contains the same atmosphere-type horror as the most-all-around praised Amnesia: The Dark Descent, although it also features several other elements that keep the game flowing smoothly and keep the player on the edge of their seat. The game does contain a good amount of jumpscares along with the overall tense feel of the environment, and even if you're not a fan of cheap spooks, Outlast does a wonderful job of placing them in areas you probably wouldn't expect them to be, getting the best reactions out of the people playing it.

Outlast also has fantastic aesthetic value, as the graphics are some of the most realistic I've seen in a long while. That being said, if you want to enjoy the full visual factor of this game, you might want to make sure your computer is up to speed.

The game does have its flaws, of course. The story is well placed together, but in order to fully understand it, you'll have to make sure to collect all of the documents and notes you come across, making the experience a bit confusing and monotonous at certain times. I personally also had my dislikes with how the entire thing came to a close at the end, as it wasn't the best wrap-up I've seen.

Although it has a few rough spots, Outlast is an overall excellent experience, and I was satisfied throughout the entire game. It's also the only horror title I've ever played that's caused me literal chest pain and nausea. Like, ever. So it's pretty damn good. Pick it up if you've got the coin. A definite must-buy for horror fans.
