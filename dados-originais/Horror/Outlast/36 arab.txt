Just a quick note before I begin. Half the reviews I read down here were just people saying that they played for like an hour before closing the game out of fear. I'm giving a legitimate review as someone who's had multiple playthroughs of Outlast, and about three fourths through Whistleblower. Alright, without further ado, here goes.


Before I got this game, I really, really wanted it. In fact ever since it was announced and released, I wanted it. It seemed legitimately scary and, overall, just a fun game. A few months ago for my birthday, my friend was kind enough to get it and Whisteblower for me together. Needless to say, I was overjoyed, installed and played the game immediately. I started a new game on Normal and began my playthrough. After finishing my first serious playthrough, I played through it again. Both times were a hell of a lot of fun, and some scares still get to me. I really did love this game, and I'm loving Whistleblower just as much.

Stories aside, you probably want the actual review. Fair enough and I'll give it to you.
Pros
-Great, tense atmosphere
-Amazing, immersive sound and music design
-Enemy design is absolutely terrifying, character and model-wise, Eddie and Trager are prime examples
-Full body awareness
-Simplistic "parkour" system that lets you traverse the map in various ways to help hide and run from enemies
-Player characters actually have implied personalities
-Every character has their own unique personality that gives them their own charm
-For the most part, you actually feel like you're in danger, and you feel compelled to run away from the danger and survive
With that said, for a first game, and just on its own, Outlast really, REALLY outdoes itself.

Cons
-Cliched setting, and semi-cliched story, it's been done before, though I will give Red Barrels credit for making it work
-Deus Ex Machinas, they're in abundance, I mean Miles and Waylon are LITERALLY the luckiest people on Earth
-Trager could have used more of a role, for his character
-The ending in Outlast was kind of a buzzkill, though Whistleblower makes up for it
Based on your opinion, the cons can outweigh the pros or the pros can outweigh the cons. I went with the latter.

Final verdict
Now, finally, the final verdict I give to Outlast. My final verdict is a 8.9/10. It would have scored higher, and may change, if I knew what else is to come of Whistleblower. Expect an update by that time, but this, for now, is my final verdict. I really loved Outlast, and I feel it's deserving of all the praise it got. Now we just have to wait for Outlast 2, yay!
