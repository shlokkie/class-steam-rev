Outlast is a first-person survival horror game. As an investigative journalist you explore an abandoned mental asylum. There you will find yourself soon being hunted by some sick individuals who still wander its halls. 
Most of the time you will spend between heart pounding encounters exploring the hospital, trying to find clues to the mystery that landed you there in the first place. You will also spend most of that downtime dreading the next encounter because you never quite know when its going to hit you next.
Outlast is a dark game. Without your handy camcorder and its nifty night vision display, you would not be able to play this game. Survival depends almost exclusively on managing your supply of camera batteries for fear of losing your ability to see. You must keep a close eye on your camera battery at all times and remain aware that the battery will drain faster if the night vision is turned on. The night vision effect itself is portrayed beautifully and really manages to capture the essense of a found footage film.
Combat is not existent and emphasis is instead placed on trying to outsmart your attackers and hiding in moments of desperation. When you can not shake your attacker, the best option is to break line of sight and find a place to hide. As a result, the gameplay feels like a satisfying game of cat and mouse. Situations often boil down to a desparate run for survival that have you barreling over objects and looking back over your shoulder as crazed madmen pursue you.
The game looks fantastic and the sound design in Outlast is awesome. The sound is the glue that keeps the whole thing together. Everything from ambient noise to your own character's heightened breathing in moments of panic is excellent.
Outlast is the best horror experience I have had in years. It is a must have for fans of the horror genre.
