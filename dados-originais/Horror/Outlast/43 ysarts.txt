WELL HOLY SH*T!
Yep, I probably said this many times while playing this game. What a nice way to kick off a review right? Let's get into it.
So, Outlast is a first person horror game in (mostly) see-through-camera perspective.

With breath-taking jumpscares you get right into this glorious and disturbing adventure by getting the job to inpsect the Mount Massive Asylum, this criminally insane (partly) abandoned Asylum sets the atmosphere of this game fairly... well f*cking creepy. It was originally run by Nazi Germans to conduct researches for the USA, but 1971 it was finally closed - caused by the brutal murder of three scientists.

Enough spoilers, let's look at it graphically. I must say, aesthetically this game indeed serverd a great job of giving you the shivers... from dark creepy places to corpse-filled bloody rooms, it has all the horror classics you can imagine... well let's forget about the forest-clich√©. Story-wise, I am... fairly dissapointed. Excitement was not really built up, the storyline was pretty casual but I guess that's a matter of taste, right? Controls were casual, artwork was great, overall a pretty shivering horror game, but definetely nothing for people with weak nerves.

8/10
