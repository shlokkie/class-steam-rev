Outlast is the best horror game since 2010's Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

A bold statement, but after fully playing through the game I believe it is warranted.

Outlast sports visuals that could easily top most Triple A studio releases, yet it is technically an indie game, released only on Steam by the developer (and later PS4).

Visuals are actually somewhat important in a horror game, as they can help propel good atmosphere into total full blown atmosfear. There is an area later on in the game, a open courtyard for the asylum that has rain pouring down and is completely pitch black, save for intermittent flashes of lightning. It looks absolutely spectacular and I haven't seen such good lightning in a video game since STALKER.

Most horror games will have high quality sound design and Outlast has some of the best sound design in any horror game I've come across. The music is haunting, subtle and memorable, and when you're cowering in the shadows you wish it would go away just like the crazed denizens of the asylum. Sound effects are executed perfectly, everything from footsteps to slamming doors and ambient noises will leave you questioning whether that noise you heard was just ambient noise or something sinister in the darkness.

Arguably, the story is the only thing that could be really criticized as being underwhelming. The story of a reporter who investigates an asylum due to an anonymous tip and the horror and events that unfold is definitely not an original idea. Then again, if you're looking for original stories in horror you'll probably be disappointed most of the time, as most ideas have already been done. The final area of the game and the ending could potentially not sit well with some people, but I enjoyed it.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed Outlast and I don't think a horror game will come out that will top it till Frictional's next project, SOMA.

Demerson's overall score for Outlast: 8 dangly inmate ♥♥♥♥♥ out of 10.
