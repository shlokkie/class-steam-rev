We accidently summoned a god, so we hid in a locker. Then some guy came in and opened all but the last locker (where we were hiding) and stood there, waiting to see if the locker would open itself. When we emerged he shouted “Yes” as if his entire life dream had been accomplished - he proved he wasn’t insane because finally, the locker opened itself.

Outlast isn’t a game about the horrors of being trapped inside a mental asylum, it’s a game about fulfilling the dying wishes of crazy people. 

10/10 would hide in a locker again
