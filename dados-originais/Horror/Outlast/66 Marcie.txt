Whoever tells you "this is only a two hour long game" is lying. I've heard so many people say it's short, boring and only good for jump scares but it's so much better than that. There's a great story, unique characters, LONG gameplay (I've got 8 hours invested so far and i'm still on chapter 5. there are 8 chapters.)
Like I said, there is storyline and there is a thick plot. There are plot twists that you wouldn't expect and sometimes you'll even feel guilty for killing or seeing a character die. The game attatches to you. I've found myself gritting my teeth through entire gameplay and not even realizing it till I come to a checkpoint. 
There's more than 'jump scares'. There's chase, anxiety and the process of prey and predator. All you can do is hide most of the time so when you can finally fight back during times you have a sense of acomplishment. 
I could go deeper into the details of difficulty and finding batteries but it's all really just a matter of narrowing your resources and using them wisely--mostly just batteries. 
Honestly the only problem I've had with this game is that it tends to get confusing when running away from enemies in a small hallway or room. You will bump into walls and get stuck behind objects but it's easy to get out of. It's nothing to deduct from this wonderful game.
