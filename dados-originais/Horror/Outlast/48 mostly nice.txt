Jesus f’n Christ s**t balls this game is hella messed up! I’m talking straight up deranged, demented and disgusting! This is the kind of horror that terrifies the likes of Clive Barker & makes Stephen King look under the bed at night! It’s hard to imagine what kind of sick individual has written this abomination of a game, but I imagine me and him would get on just great. 

Truly, there are many horror survival type games out that have done the whole “trapped in an insane asylum” blah blah so cliché… but wait, this is different. There is a sick, twisted quality in the lining that sets it apart and offers up something, dare I say – interesting, no, maybe intriguing? It leaves the same kind of impact Silent Hill did all those years ago when you first played it; a combination of perfect atmosphere from the infinitely well-tuned audio, the visual disgust of ‘no-limits’ gore & the clever writing for the sicko’s you face off against. 

This game is a steal at its price, it will have you pooping your pants and re-thinking every horror game you played up till now. All other horror titles that release now have a benchmark, and I’m sure this game, with it’s planned DLC it will outlast most new contenders. 9/10.
