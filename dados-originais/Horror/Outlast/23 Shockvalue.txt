No matter who you are, no matter what you experienced in your life so far, no matter how cold your soul has become: THIS game will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you !!! Forget Amnesia. Amnesia is a little fart compared to Outlast. You're playing a journalist who has to investigate an empty psychiatry. But sooner or later you will find out that this psychiatrie is not empty and the battle for survival begins. There exist no weapons, only some beings in this psychatrie have weapons and they will use them against you. You can only run away and hide. Your camera is the only thing you have. Run, hide, film and hope. Outlast is one of the best Steam-games I have ever played so far. I can only recommend it to people who like horror-games and have the guts to play it. If you thought Amnesia is scary, then try this! It's the best horror-game existing so far !
