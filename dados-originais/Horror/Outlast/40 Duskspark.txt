Before you read on, here's a true story.
I started playing Outlast for the first time on the same night I ate spicy Mexican food for supper. Within the first half hour of the game I got scared so hard combined with the poor digestion of overly-spiced food that I literally sh*t myself. 
So there's that.
Now, what is Outlast? Is it just another first person horror game? Well, basically it is, yes. But that's not a bad thing at all.
Outlast puts you in a mental asylum gone batsh*t sour, arming you with nothing but a nightvision camera. From there on you'll sneak and crawl through the asylum. Unfortunately for you, you're not the only sneaking and crawling person in there. 
There are no weapons (no guns, no chainsaws, no large purple d*ldo's or whatever tickles your imagination) to defend yourself with. You either run and hide or you stay and die. Is it that simple? Well it could've been if they had payed their damn electricity bills.
The asylum you get to explore in Outlast is dark, and I mean dark dark. You will rarely be able to see without using your camera's nightvision function, and even if you use it there's a chance your battery runs out. Now THAT delivers an entirely different level of "scare" to the table.
There are jumpscares, I'll admitt it, but those will be the least of your problems. Your main problem is that you know you're not alone, and that you don't know whether you are or aren't.
If you're tired of shooting your way out of scary s(h)ituations, treat yourself to Outlast. It's scary, it's atmospheric, and it's definately worth every minute you dare to spend playing it.
Oh, PS: don't eat spicy food before playing. God damn me...
