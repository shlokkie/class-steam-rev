As a huge fan of horror and adventure games in general that tell an explorative and deep story, I was simply blown away by the quality of the content that the game offered. I was expecting great things from Frictional knowing that they had come from Amnesia the Dark Descent and I was not disappointed. They have made huge leaps in story depth, environment design and character development. Everything that I can think of that made Amnesia great is present as well as a new and original concept for a psychological horror game that gives it a completely new and chilling basis.

If you're a fan of horror in general, this game is a must have. I was engrossed from the very beginning up until the end and while there may not be as many scares as there were in Amnesia and Frictional's older Penumbra series, the game's pace, continuity and development is even more sinister and unsettling.

I don't write reviews but for gems like this, it is a pleasure. I'd rate the game a solid 9/10 with no real let downs other than perhaps the lower frequency of those truly horrific chases and scares. In the end, the balance felt just right and you get plenty of opportunity to ponder over the game's questions and enjoy its beautiful environments before being thrown back into a spiral of terror.

Highly recommended for those looking for a meaningful story, outstanding immersion and some good ol' andrenalin.
