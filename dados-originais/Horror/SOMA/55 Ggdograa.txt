SOMA is the latest first person horror themed walking simulator, developed by Frictional games, the very same guys who helped pioneer the genre with titles like Penumbra and Amnesia the Dark Descent.

You're a guy named Simon going in for a brain scan at a suspiciously abandoned research facility. During this routine scan something appears to go wrong and you wake up 100 years later, inside an underwater station overrun with robots.

This really is a well crafted and believable world, it takes a lot of cues from other games like Bioshock and System Shock. Where as in Bioshock you felt like the ocean was taking the city of Rapture back, in SOMA you get this sense of machinery taking over everything, as large robotic appendages jut out of walls and block hallways and corridors.

There's about 5 different monster types in the game, all of which you simply have to avoid. We've seen this kind of thing in dozens of first person horror games lately, the enemy patrols around an enclosed area and you have to collect something in that area or just get through it unseen.

At it's core, SOMA is a casual horror game for people who can't handle inventory and resource management and who find the idea of a health bar off putting. People looking for a hardcore horror game set underwater, avoiding murderous robots and scraping by for resources might want to look elsewhere.
