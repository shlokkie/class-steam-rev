Game of the year, hands down. From the atmosphere, brilliant writing, pacing, puzzles, exploration, and ethical mind benders SOMA is one of the most assured indie titles I have ever played. Elements of Dead Space, amnesia, alien and event horizon but doesn't blantantly rip these ideas, instead SOMA creates an incredibly immersive interactive and detailed sci fi world. Despite a slightly older engine and lower resolution textures than I would like, the game does manage to pull off some impressive underwater scenes. The audio design is superb. I only noticed one serious bug towards the end which a reload of a save fixed. And despite what everyone says, headphones on at night and you will crap yourself, it does have some terrifying sections. I can only wish for more titles like this. A must play title.
