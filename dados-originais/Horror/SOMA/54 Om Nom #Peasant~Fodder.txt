Life ruined by car accident, dashed hopes and false promises. No, this will not be your another casual story. Rather the worst hangover after weekend drinking you ever experienced. Your life will take serious steep fall, suddenly you are at places you never knew they exist, news you never wanted to know and decisions you never wanted to make.

The game just found the perfect balance between horror atmosphere, story telling and exploring environment. The balance I so missed in Alien: Isolation and Machine for Pigs. Add non-repetitive more open level design, emotional music, superb voice acting and plot twists and you get everything you hoped for.

Frictional games brought their horror game to another level again, showing us they still haven't lost it after mediocre Machine for Pigs (made by another studio but still super-vised by them).
