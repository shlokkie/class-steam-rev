SOMA Review

In the newest creation by Frictional Games you get to play Simon Jarett, who ends up with a brain damage after a tragic car crash. For his cure he has to take medicine frequently and also get his brain scanned by a doctor, who invites him to his office at the beginning of the game. But as soon as the scan begins you realize that something went terribly wrong, waking up in a completely other place and the doctor disappearing. I don't want to reveal more since it would spoiler the main story, so I'm just going for the pro's and con's of the game I've experienced so far.

The Pro's

+ Frictional games has learned from it's previous developed games in terms of graphics, sound and storytelling
+ Different pictures, E-Mails, audiologs and letters reveal parts of the story and open questions
+ Fully explorable environment, so taking your time looking for clues of the story will pay off
+ A very unsettling and deep atmosphere, supported by the amazing soundtrack of composer Mikko Tarmia, who already developed the soundtrack of the Penumbra series and Amnesia: The Dark Descent
+ The character you play and those you meet are interesting and also extraordinary
+ There aren't as many jumpscares as in Amnesia, but that's not a bad point. The maps are bigger and there is more to explore. In addition to that the stressful moments of the game are really well timed and intense


The Con's

- There is no real replayability
- Some textures look stale and should be fixed
- Occasional FPS drops ...
- ... leading to frustrating deaths


The Verdict

After all the game achieved what it intended to become: a thrilling, atmospheric and story driven horror experience.
So if you are interested in any type of horror game you should definitely give this one a shot.
