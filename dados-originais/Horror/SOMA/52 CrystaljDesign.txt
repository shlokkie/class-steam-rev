This isn't Amnesia 2.0 and that's a good thing. This is an evolution of the template laid out by Amnesia to tell a kind of story that hasn't been explored this well in the medium before. It's not perfect, but it feels like a true step forward in the slow crawl toward the maturation of videogames.

There are no "Renegade" or "Paragon" black and white moral choices. In fact, they have little to no effect on the story. But you feel them nontheless. Your choices can haunt you.

The game, like most, leans on the trope of audio and text message logs to help fill in the story. In this case, I felt they were *just* long enough to not wear out their welcome. There is also a lot of environmental storytelling that encourages you to let your imagination run wild.

I'm usually pretty bad at traditional adventure games but I was able to complete the game with no outside help. This really helped keep me immersed in the story.

DON'T buy this game if you are looking for something to constantly give you jump scares.

DO buy this game if you want to experience an incredibly unsettling atmosphere with an engaging story that will leave you questioning yourself and the nature of what it means to be alive.
