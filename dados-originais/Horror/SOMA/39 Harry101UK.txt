Absolutely fantastic. Easily one of the best, most thrilling gaming experiences I've ever had. It really makes you think about our humanity and morality. Has some genuinely tense and frightening scenes, and the atmostphere builds up incredibly well throughout the game.

Gameplay is very similar to Amnesia and Alien: Isolation. You don't have any weapons, and must use the environment to your advantage. The physics and puzzles really work well together.

The environments are similiar to Bioshock, so fans of deep-sea areas will be in for a treat! Anyone afraid of the deep sea and the murky abyss will be terrified!

Audio design and foley are some of the best I've heard; definitely up to a similar standard set by Alien: Isolation, which was also incredibly detailed, rich and terrifying.

SOMA also makes use of a brilliant physics engine, where every object in the world can be picked up, rotated, examined, thrown, etc. This includes pulling your mouse to slide open drawers and doors, etc, which really adds to the immersive exploration.

Set aside an evening, turn off all the lights, put on your headphones and lose yourself at the bottom of the ocean.
