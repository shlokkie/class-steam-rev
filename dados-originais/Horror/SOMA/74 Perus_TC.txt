Ok,absolutely one of the most engrossing,creepy,well thought out,brilliantly written pieces of video art I have ever had the pleasure of owning and playing.The sound design alone is worth the price of admission.The best 25 bucks I have spent since last year.Alien Isolation is the ONLY game I enjoyed as much or more than this title.You have no weapons,just your wits and an omni-tool.The story really keeps you involved with NO gaps in the telling whatsoever.Spotless.Just a note to Frictional Devs.......You quit making games like this and I am coming looking for you....... ;) 11\10

Oh yes,I forgot to mention....having played Amnesia and the (Penumbra on disk) series I am ecstatic that this one holds true to the bloodline.VERY well done!
