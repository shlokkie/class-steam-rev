Simply put, in terms of story, lore, characters, setting and atmosphere it is without a doubt the best game made by Frictional Games to date. As for the "horror" aspect of it... well, the game for sure can be scary for some, but as far as I'm concerned, horror aspect of this game it nowhere near as important as the things I have mentioned above and for that alone this game is more than worth your attention.

Final Verdict:

9,5/10
