A true return to form. For those who did not like A Machine for Pigs, this game corrects all the mistakes you think it had.
The game is paced as well as The Dark Decent, but has more of an opening which makes the player involved, your involvement has more of an impact as well. Amnesia might have had Agrippa but this game has a few... people. It's a game I actually completed, which is rare. In a world were MGS V lays unfinished in my library.

Some of the puzzles can be hard to figure out on a first glance, but there are small little hints around the room to give you a hand. The writing in the game is solid and the voice acting is also pretty good. Catherine, your only friend, is a personality I love and respect.

The music is an important aspect of horror games and the sound is wounderful. It changes based on what is going on, similar to Amnesia there is "patrolling" music which lets you know how ♥♥♥♥ed you are. Sound design is incredibly important and Frictional took the time and care for the game to be the best it could. Thank you for another amazing game, Frictional. Top notch work.

Also, ♥♥♥♥ Theta.
