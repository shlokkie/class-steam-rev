A true master piece of gaming! The story is amazing and with both the visuals and sounds complimenting each other, it brings an almost movie like experience. Even though this is a horror game, it is not your standard style. It borrows from both Amneisa and Penumbra series with its creative flair, giving it just the right amount of horror, in the right locations. This is a combination of both Frictional Games past glory, mixed with their new take on what "true horror" may well be.

A blend of horror game, that is rare and unique in many ways. This will surely become a 'cult classic' as it ages. Congratulations to the Dev Team for releasing such a solid game! Truely remarkable! Thanks.

I highly recommend this game to anyone, even those who are not dedicated horror fans. It will leave you questioning and make you think about life in a whole new way!

5 out of 5 Beers from me.
