Best horror game so far, Yes, that's it.

Great controls, amazing story, nice graphics (not the best, but nice), incredible ambient and soud effects.

Compared to Amnesia: The Dark Descent (now the second best), SOMA almost has not puzzles, but it doesn't need them, it's all in the atmosphere and the story.

Just the perfect game.
