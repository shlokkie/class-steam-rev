Flawed in sections, but overall fantastic

I didn't know what to expect from this game. I saw one teaser trailer but other than that went in completely unaware of what SOMA would be. I've played Amnesia: The dark descent (though I never could finish it), but I think the two are quite different.

The story and pacing of this game are fantastic. Apart from a few sections where I felt my progress was being held back by the devs trying too hard to make me feel uncomfortable or push a bit of backstory, the whole thing flows like a long movie.

The scares become annoyances pretty quickly, but having said that I never really lost the feeling of immersion and every new chapter had me willing to give the game another chance.

Pick up this game, play it just for the story. It's a unique and great concept and you won't regret playing it through til the end.
