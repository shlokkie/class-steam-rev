After 5 hours in game the story kicks it with horrible monsters!

The atmosphere is really good, it keeps making you wonder what actually happened in this isolated underwater hell-of-a-mess if not already busying trying to get past that freaking monster in front of you. This is the part where Alien:Isolation (My another favorite horror game) falls short of, but it compensates for a more thrilling combat experience and inventory management.

Talking about the monster in this game, I can't qutie understand their AI but i think they are hardcoded to circle around me, just like the Xenomorph in Alien:Isolation, this is sad cause that means they will never give you a break no matter how sneaky you are.

( I was hoping to sneak past them or lure them to a remote area so i can earn my time to read every notes without pressure but obviosuly i was wrong :\ )

In conclusion I think this game is very successful in creating a new horor experience without naive jump scares or abused uses of gore, good work Frictional Games!
