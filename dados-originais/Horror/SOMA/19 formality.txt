Improves on TDD and AMFP in every aspect, this is easily Frictional's best work, even over the Penumbra series. An amalgamation of Alien: Isolation, Bioshock, Amnesia, and The Talos Principle.

It has some of the most memorable enemy encounters and environments I've ever seen in a horror game, with a brilliant and well told story that will consistently leave you with chills. Those who're looking for an easily accessible game for some simple scares - this is not it. This is a game to play alone and at night, to immerse yourself in, and to put yourself into the shoes of your character, and ask yourself the same questions he asks right up until the end.

I personally found this game to be phenomenal, wouldn't change a thing. But the gameplay is still simplified as it was in AMFP, although I find it streamlines the process and allows you to focus on the story, it's also dialogue and text/audio log heavy, so if you're not down for reading and listening a lot - this isn't the game for you.

This game will terrify you, but come for the story, not the scares.
