It's rare to find something so intelligent and thought provoking.

I adored the 'Dark Descent', and while SOMA has its moments; on the horror scale I still find the Dark Descent to be the scarier experience (though don't get me wrong, Soma can be very frightening). In retrospect I believe that this is mostly due to the resource gathering and subsequent managment, which is of course a great mechanic for creating its own prevailing sense of tension i.e never having enough resources and watching what you do possess slowly drain away. Soma can't quite match this horror because it doesn't have resource gathering. Which is perhaps the only downer and carryover from the disappointing 'A Machine for Pigs'. But something I can easily forgive in light of everything else.

But the story of SOMA.... Oh, the story of SOMA is something quite glorious!! It is up there with the very best of anything I've ever played before, and crushes most. It really is a stunning piece of work. I was utterly consumed by it, and it left me pondering questions everytime I finished a session and turned my PC off. The nature of reality, what reality is, what defines the real "me" and what it means to be human - the story is able to deliver these otherwise potentially exhausting and overwhelming theological subjects in an interesting way.

Yes, the gameplay is solid, the horror is there, as are the puzzles (though easier and less tactile than the Dark Descent). The oppressive and rich atmosphere, the good (in some cases stunning) visuals, the serviceable voice acting etc. No resource gathering but otherwise everything you'd expect from Frictional. But the story raises the whole thing beyond the realms of good and into something that is quite magnificent. (At least imo).

Soma was, for me, an incredible experience, a gem of a game that rarely comes along. Like a great book that you can't put down. This game was unforgettable.
