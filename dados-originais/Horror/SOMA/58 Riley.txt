SOMA was one of the best video game experiences Ive had in a long time. Its been very long since a game made me feel so much. One of the most immersive and present experiences Ive had and I can see it being very well represented on VR platforms. But this game was more for me. As a narrative it dealt with things that not many books even have. Themes present throughout SOMA are real life theories and philosophies that I was aware of before hand. But the way they are tied in together is so beautifully done. The writing, the characters, the setting, everything was done so perfectly to me. I ultimately am happy, proud, and excited that SOMA is what it is. Its finally an example that you could show to an outside person as an example of the medium being used as an artistic narrative. This is an experience, one that captivates such as books and movies do, but on such a deeper and more personal level, and I hope we see more like it. Because we need more games that are here to not only give us a past time but tell us a great story and make us feel like a part of it.
