I was chased by an invisible water monster. I threw a bible at it and the creature bled.

10/10   Would throw another bible to induce bleeding because IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!


Jokes aside, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an atmospheric horror game. Like the advice recommended upon starting the game up for the first time, you do not play to win. Rather, you play to survive. There is no difficulty setting and there are no quicksaves whatsoever, just the usual autosaves and the ability to save once to exit the game. This allows players to not worry too much on when to save and focus more on survival.

The sounds in Amnesia have been worked very well. Upon playing in the dark with headphones, the immersive abilities of the game kick in. The constant echos in the stone castles or creaks on aged wooden planks remind players they are in an ancient castle where help is so far away. Literally, the only way to be comfortable for a moment is in a properly confined room with a lit candle...or the closet.

Why the closet? Well, there are enemies in this game...and they are legitimately scary. Hardly anything competes against their hideous apperance and merciless intentions to seek and kill you. I dare you to stare face to face at a humanoid being who has reptile eyes and its lower jaw has been detached from its face. Oh and, it hates being stared at because if it sees you, it will try to slash you.

There is almost no way to run if such an encounter occurs. Just throw something at it to stun and then run like hell. Or, if you are lucky, hide in the closet and beg for mercy. When the monster attacks you in the closet, you will know sh!t hit the fan so hard, it's everywhere and out of control. Why are there no weapons in the game? Having even a knife would ruin the scare factor and the game would not be so scary anymore.

While avoidng enemies, exploration is the key to find essential but quite rare items. Light (and typically the closet) is your best friend but the lantern consumes so much oil and jars of it is so rare, nothing can make you happier if you find one. There are tinderboxes to light up torches and candles but beware. They cannot be put out unlike the lantern and you really do not want to be in a well lit room when a monster comes in growling.

Of course, it would seem like common sense to not use the lantern and lit up dark areas. Upon doing so, your sanity can be drained faster. At the lowest level, it then works against you and cannot be repaired or reverted when trying to stare at a lit up candle, only nullified. At high insanity, hallucinations take over and can appear more often than the real threats and your movement and literally stop. This leaves you helpless...especially when a monster is nearby and you need to run or hide. As such, making progress, such as finding an quest related item, is the only thing to help the poor soul of Daniel.

Who is Daniel? He's an unlucky chap who was pulled into this mess. Avoiding too many spoilers, he decided to drag himself into an ancient castle and after terrible events, Daniel must pull himself together and kill the person mostly responsible for his predicament. He can't leave the cursed castle until this is done. As such, to learn about his past which he erased from his memory, there are notes scattered about and flashbacks that depict the horror before the game starts. In a way, this breaks the fourth wall because reading them helps to soothe the player's paranoia in the real world upon playing the game for so long!

Eventually, the main storyline/campaign gets boring when one memorizes where the monsters spawn and such. Thus, the game introduced the wonderful feature to install custom stories. Some of them, which, are even more terrifying than the base game. You've been warned.

The only complaint I had was some of the gameplay features. Closing and opening a door, for example, takes some getting used to. Instead of pressing "e" to interact, one needs to press "use" and then use the mouse to open it at a desirable speed. Thankfully, there is some time to practice that at the very beginning of the game.

In conclusion, these traits are what many games and movies lack, especially Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Thus, I highly recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent who want a refreshing horror experience.
