SOMA is another outstanding horror game from Frictional, even though its a bit light on horror. What makes this game so impressive is the incredibly natural pacing, storytelling and puzzles where it is pretty much always clear what you need to do/where you need to go despite a complete lack of any sort of UI or objectives screen. Even during the relatively open ocean walking sequences I never became lost, almost as if the devs intuatively knew which way players would go. Puzzles are of similar quality; generally you aren't really told what needs to be done, but it can be quite easily figure it out based on the context.

The story is also a highlight, diving into some similar themes as last year's The Talos Principle. While I didn't find the narrative quite as thought provoking as that game, the way the story is told is masterful. Conversations with another character move the central plot forward, but there is a incredible amount of often very important detail to be found in exploring the environment and interacting with various computers/documents that are lying around. It is all done in such a non gamey way that this science fiction game manages to feel more grounded in reality than many games based in todays real world.

All of this adds up to make the game incredibly immersive. This is aided by stellar sound design that is responsible for much of the tension throughout the relatively lengthy game (for this genre). There are still some terrifying sequences, with a couple of memorable ones later in the game I will likely not forget any time soon. I would say that SOMA is the pinnacle of immersive story driven gaming, with near AAA production values (they just need to work on character models) making it easy to forget this is coming from a small indie developer.

Frictional have once again proven themselves to be masters of their genre, and waiting to see what they do next will be a painful process.
