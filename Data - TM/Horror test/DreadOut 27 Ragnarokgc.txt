i was following this game since it was on indiegogo project my firts toughs about this final release its that they have improved their graphics since the demo, atmosphere and monsters really scary(wah!), this is fresh air for the horror games industry; im pretty satisfied with this game, for first time buyers please take in mind that this is the first full project from a recent found game company. sure game will become better on the next release with some tweaks and adjustments, Digital Happiness sure have gained another follower :)
