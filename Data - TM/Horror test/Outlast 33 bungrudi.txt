This is how you should play the game: 
1. medium big screen with high res so you can see the scary details, and high FPS to prevent motion sickness
2. proper headset so you can hear your character's gasping breath and other magnificent sound details
3. play when you're alone so you wont be a laughing stock when you fall from your chair after a dead body fall from the ceiling right before you enter a room

As I write this, my playtime is still minimal because I still to need to regain my balls.

You think you're awesomely though after watching Paranormal Activity? Try this game..
