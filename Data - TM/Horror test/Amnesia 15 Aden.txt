A horror game masterpiece that takes away all your feelings of saftey and security and gives you two options. Run, or hide. This is an exceptionally unnerving way to play and will challenge you as fear grips you and you must think quickly on your feet to stay alive! Play at night, alone with headphones, or with a whole bunch of your sissy friends who can't stand horror anything! You will get laughs and screams and your experience will be bolstered if you have two or more people watching you play! Alone though,...late at night? Heh heh heh. That can get to you, especially if your a little tired, but not so much that you pass out. :P If your mind is already vunerable in some way, this game will take down your berriers and screw with you. It has a lot of psychological horror to it, and some of it has absolutely nothing to do with the monsters and the darnkess that follows you.
