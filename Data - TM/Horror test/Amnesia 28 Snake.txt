I bought this game near release, full price, and still have not completed it. I am a 30 year old man and I am too scared to play this to the end. I am currently making another go at it, let's see how it goes, because the setting and plot seem amazing.

This is not intended to be one of those humorous reviews where people exaggerate for thumbs up, I am literally terrified by so many things in this game that I find it nearly impossible to play. Enter at your own peril.
