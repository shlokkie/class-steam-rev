Not as scary or physically stressfull as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but not less unconfortable. SOMA is a psycological nightmare that asks moral questions that made me question what is to be human. A narrative masterpiece and a fantastic follow up to the classic Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Two very different games but both fantastic.

4,5/5
