Aspects of DreadOut Worth Criticizing

● Extremely Low Resolution Textures & Pop In. This game showcases some the of worst textures in recent memory with some textures being worse than in games released 10 years prior! Regardless of your hardware specifications you're going to experience vegetation pop in.

● Settings Don't Update When Selected. You can't get past the first screen inwhich you select the language you desire your subtitles to be in unless you restart the game. You also can't change the resolution to a non native resolution unless you restart your system while your desktop is in that desired resolution.

● Pre Rendered Cutscene Outfit Issue. Regardless of what outfit you're wearing from the Soundtrack & Manga downloadable content, some cutscenes will feature Linda in her default school outfit.
