Everything you loved from the first Amnesia is back in this game and it's amazing!

The horror and atmosphere are terrific just as I thought they would be, but what really surprised me was just how beautiful this game was. Especially when you wander the ocean floor, the details that make up the environment really make you feel immersed and it's a beautiful experience. What frictional games has always done well was implementing down times in their games, that give the player a moment to catch their breath, and this game is no exception. It makes jumping back into terrifying situations that much worse. The only thing I have to complain about is the occasional framedrop that I experience, but it usually only happens during loading times (and I do have good specs, 970, i7, and 16 gigs of ram)
