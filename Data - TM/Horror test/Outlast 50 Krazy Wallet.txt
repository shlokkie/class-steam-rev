So how shall I put this? I love horror movies. I am one of those masochistic people who sits alone in an empty house with all of the lights off and watches the scariest movies I can find. I saw some reviews for Outlast and everyone is flipping out saying how scary it is. Well being the brilliant person that I am, I thought it sounded fun. I am alone in my apartment with the lights out and I am all set to start the game. I was then called a little pig and thrown through a window. After a new pair of underpants, I gave the game a second go. Then the lights went out. I now need therapy.
