DreadOut is a survival horror with a third person view   also use your smartphone in first person view to detect strange things around you.

Setting is an Indonesian ghost town, it's original! Some ghosts stories used are from local legends.

It features old school puzzles and logics, no hints/in game help, which is great for this kind of games!
The "fun" is here with the encounters you make, sometimes they will stalk you and bring some good moments of stress!

Act 1 is currently out, Act 2 is coming soon for free, plus a paid "ghost chase in the town" DLC will be available too.

If you love survival horror games, give it a serious look!

A free demo is already out too, it is like a prologue so even if you have the game play it!
