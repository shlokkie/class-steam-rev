5/10

genre : survival horror in 3rd person mode (can switch to 1st person in game)

+ good presentation (if you play with normal high res textures), nice ghosts design, dark and creepy atmosphere and great sound
+ gameplay is about exploring the haunted environment and progressing the story by finding documents to read and beating ghosts with your smart phone , in a fatal frame like way   some scarce puzzles to solve again using your smart phone
+ the puzzles are well thought and challenging
+ it is indeed a traditional , old school horror game and although it looks similar gameplay wise to fatal frame, it actually plays differently (i didn't notice any similarities to silent hill series like many people have mentioned though)

  cliche story
  you become more frustrated (by the gameplay) than scared
  i guess this will be resolved, but after the addition of episode 2 textures were downgraded for 64 bit systems and it shows
  i don't like the level design, first an open space in the old town with very few things to see and do (mainly looking for some medals and beating your first ghost) , then an un originally designed school interior with few things to do again
  lots of bugs, some game breaking, since i lost my progress twice after a patch and had to restart from the beginning (won't do that again unless they fix the game entirely)
  easy to get lost due to the poor level design

was hoping for more out of this game, maybe the greenlit game i was waiting for more than any other, but i was not that thrilled playing it. since i love horror games i still get some enjoyment out of it (still playing it) but in comparison to classics of the genre like silent hill and fatal frame it is way inferior. 
recommended to hardcore horror fans only but at its current state i won't recommend it generally as a good horror game to play.
