SOMA may go down as one of my favorite science fiction games ever. The less you know about it going in the better, but it's got one of the most compelling and thought provoking stories of any game I've ever played. A lot of people may overlook this game because it has kind of been lumped into the "survival horror" category since that's kind of Frictional Games' niche since they did the Amnesia games. But there's so much more to it than that.

I'm really not big on horror games. But I wouldn't really call this a horror game. It's a sci fi adventure game with horror elements. There's definitely a lot of nail biting moments and there are scary parts too. It's horror in the same way that James Cameron's "Aliens" was horror. It was more thrill than frightening, but it had its fair share of frightening moments. While in previous games made by Frictional, the story kind of revolved around the horror and the scares, in SOMA, the story is 100% the focus of the game. The scarier aspects of the game come about from the story itself, as a biproduct for everything that's happening. There were only a few portions of the game where I felt deeply uneasy and uncomfortable since the games puts you in situations where something may be...hunting you and you have no means to defend yourself. That element does play a role in the game, but the horror element pretty much stops there.

This game is like reading an incredibly riveting science fiction novel. Like one of the classics. It's so full of philosophical and existential dilemmas that revolve around things as grand as the meaning and definition of life, like what is life? Is our scientific definition for life enough? This game is incredibly creative with how it poses these questions, and it does so in a way that doesn't feel like you are being lectured to. While you are fairly isolated for most of the game, the characters that are there are complex and interesting and relatable, and realistically portrayed in terms of their personalities and interactions with each other. The world of the game itself is so well constructed that it gives itself a sense of space and scale, that it feels like a real place, not a "video game" type world where everything is sort of compacted together to fit into world of the game (kind of like the grand theft auto games which feature miniature versions of real cities). The world of SOMA feels real, immersive, and detailed (so much so that I at one point actually pulled out a map online of the fictional underwater facility that this takes place in to figure out where I was and where I was going). It's linear but with plenty of exploration and occasionally non linear objectives, similar to games like Bioshock & Half Life.

It's not that long of a game (9 12 hours cumulatively depending on how much time you explore/get lost). I know a lot of people probably will overlook this because they don't really do horror games, but like I said, I'm not a fan of horror games either, but I really loved this game. It's scary at times but it wasn't nightmare inducing, at least for me. Overall I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to any fans of sci fi games.
