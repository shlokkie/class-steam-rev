Bioshock + Source Code + Alien: Isolation + Cortana + System Shock + Pandorum +Amnesia + Dead Space + Inception + Portal 2 feels + SCP

Really good voice acting and lots of exploration, superb physics and sound design, so many big & small details were put in this, super intense scares with the most engaging story that can provoke your emotions deep inside you and makes you question about your conscious.
You make some of the most interesting choices in a video game ever, the whole game is full of FEELS.

It is the best horror game I've ever played since Alien: Isolation, I recommend it to everyone!

Trust me, you have to play it for yourself, it's unlike anything you've ever experienced before, the one time experience in your whole life that you will never forget.
