One of the best storyline thriller games I've played in a long time. I found myself totally immersed in the atmosphere and story. The game has some terrifying moments as it should from any Frictional Game. A lot of people don't like the screen glitches when a monster is near but I find it builds and adds to the story due to you being a robot. I love that the monsters interference messes with your character. It adds to the realism of the technology glitching and interfering with each other. The monsters are so confusing its terrifying. The fact that you cannot look at them to survive makes it all the more realistic and thrilling.
1. Monsters with glowing heads that make scary noises
2. Swimming in the depths of the ocean
3. Scary Angler's
4. Finding Dory
5. Question the world's existence and the meaning of life
6. Ending the game and feeling like a meaningless dot floating through space.
10/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone. Besides Simonâ€¦.
