Like a lot of players, I wanted to put my claws on SOMA for quite some time now. Yesterday I launched the game and finished it in one session. It took me ___exactly 10___ hours to finish it. A night has passed and I think I can share my thoughts now:

GOOD ASPECTS

    When you look back to Penumbra and Amnesia games, SOMA offers an enormous evolution visually speaking. The underwater world is very nicely done, whether it's in the ocean or in the facilities. A labyrinth area reminded me of a map near the end of Penumbra BP.
    The story is all about sci fi and psychological themes about life, death and continuity. It takes its importance within the game and I must say I enjoyed it more than I expected to.
    The monsters you'll have the pleasure to meet have different behaviors and attacks, which is better than just the classic "I patrol, I see/hear you, I search you, I run at you". Nice designs.
    Ambiance in the levels is often close to some areas in Doom 3, Bioshock and even Dead Space, level design speaking. A nice thing.
    The voices! Voiiiices!! Very nice addition!
    Sound effects are well processed, you can feel the hard work here.
    Choices & actions can be hard to make at different times!
    If you suffer from claustrophobia, the more you progress in the game, the deeper you'll get in the ocean and it's a great feeling! Is it?
    Modding tools included!
    The ending!!


NOT SO GOOD ASPECTS

    Textures are sometimes very low: is it a bug or not? Will it be corrected? We'll see, after all, game just came out.
    Optimization problems: SOMA worked without ANY problem for me but I see that some people have poor FPS problems on decent configurations, so this will be improved and patched soon of course.
    Puzzles a bit simple.
    No classic inventory. This will annoy some players for sure, personally it did not.
    Monsters are easy to avoid/escape if you're accustomed to Penumbra/Amnesia games.
    Game is too easy... well it's focused on story... so I guess it's ok?
    Less horror... but it has its stressful moments.
    The ending!!


To conclude, you don't need to be a fan of previous Frictional Games works to play SOMA.
This game is an ambitious turn for its creators and I believe it is a successful one, good job!
Visually, it's lovely. The SOMA universe & story are pretty fine.

If you are a fan of Bioshock and other games I named earlier here, you should give it a try, you'll like the ambience.

Mandatory recommendation to the lovers of the genre!
