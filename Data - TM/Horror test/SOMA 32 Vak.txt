Soma is the game I've been looking for a very long time. I am a huge Sci Fi horror buff, and I was looking for a game that converys all of the best parts of the genre.

This is it.

Soma starts off on a slow, but high, note and slowly picks up over time, getting more and more terrifying over time. The art and sound design are top notch, and will leave you terrified of what horrors might be next. The enemies, while they could probably be removed completely, provide a very clear sense of urgency that keeps you moving through the dark corridors of Pathos II. The writing and character direction is also something that deserves noting, as it makes you develop a connection with the main characters, and even some that you never see in person.

General Pros/Cons

Pros

    Amazing art
    Amazing sound
    Great monster design
    Gets genuinely terrifying as the game goes on
    Memorable characters (surprisingly)
    Incredibly immersive


Cons

    In areas with enemies, you don't really get to explore that much
    Doesn't seem to be optimized 100%
    A little unstable late into the game, crashed a few times while loading



Overall, SOMA is a great game, and I believe that everyone should experience it.

The abyss walk is the most terrifying part of any game I've played so far.
