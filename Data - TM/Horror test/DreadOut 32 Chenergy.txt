A throw back to the good old days of horror games before everyhing either became an action game or a Slender clone designed for streamers and lets players. After the recent disapointment in Daylight, this game filled that void for new horror game. Now that the new Fatal Frame games stopped being released outside of Japan, this game is a must have for fans of that series. At the time that I'm writing this only the first act is available and its kinda on the slow side, and nothing scared me as much as some of the things in the demo did, but I'm going to assume the content from the demo will show up in act two At the end of the first act you see one of the ghosts from the demo in a cutscene. This is the game any old school horror game fan has been waiting for and if you were a fan the Fatal Frame games you have to play this.
