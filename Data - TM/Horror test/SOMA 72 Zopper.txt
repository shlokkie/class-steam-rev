What a ride. SOMA is an awesome exploration of what humanity is. While it is certainly dark and also has horror elements, it isn't a jump scare game and your thoughts will haunt you more than anything in the game. I am glad I bought this right away and that I trusted Frictional Games to develop an even more mature game than Amnesia.
You will enjoy this game if a back story matters to you, when you enjoy if gameplay perfectly transports the narrative and of course if you enjoy a dark setting   and maybe even if you are interested in philosophical thoughts about humanity in general. Highly recommended.
