The game that will make you crap your pants. At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.

The Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.

if you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by. Many people said this game set the bar for Horror Games to a new high, rightly so. If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.

There are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.

5/5, by any means. If you're a Horror fan and you haven't played/heard of this game yet, you shou ... MUST give this game a try.
