A rather well done adventure horror game that deserves playing if you are a fan of either genre. The puzzle dynamics are a little quirky in places and can be misleading but overall they are straightforward and easy to solve. There's no combat so all you can do when confronted with an adversary is to run and/or hide but it serves to heighten the effect of how helpless you are when subject to these supernatural forces beyond your grasp. The audio and art design are well suited to one another and deliver an excellent environment for feeling the dread of the unknown as you thread further into the depths where your destiny awaits. So fear or no fearâ€¦ this game deserves mustering enough chutzpah, guts, gumption and whatever else you got to spare in order to play.
