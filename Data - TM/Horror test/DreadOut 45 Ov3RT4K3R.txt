DreadOut is a third person indie horror game.
The game consists of 2 acts and also the content from the demo makes an appearance.
The game starts off with the female protagonist Linda, her teacher and a number of her classmates finding themselves stranded in an abandoned town. The path leads directly through the town and to the school where the game truly starts.
Linda moves around in the third person, but the only way to fight or sometimes even see ghosts, is by switching to the first person camera mode. Combat in DreadOut is pretty similar to Fatal Frame. When ghosts get close enough, the image on your camera will distort and snapping pictures at that moment damages them. You will also use your phone's flashlight function to search through dark corners for clues.
The visuals, while obviously not up to the level of a triple A PC game, are not the best, but still okay for an indie game.
The sound effects are good so far. 
The game is not really scary and the story is also not really brilliant. But fans of asian horror movies should give a try to DreadOut, it delivers a good atmosphere of the good old asian horror movies.
