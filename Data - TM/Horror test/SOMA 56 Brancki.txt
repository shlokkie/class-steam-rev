This is hands down the best story for a game I've ever played in my life. I did not really like their previous games at all. It was not as scary I expected it to be but definitely had its moments, Which was definitely an upside to me as I dont usually like any kind of horror games. This is a great game, It has some rough sides here and there but it makes up for it with the incredible well made atmosphere where you want to explore every corner of the map while finding more clues about the story. All in which the sound design excels aswell where actors did a great job at making it sound very believeable.

It's been a while since I've been so immersed in a game before, I did not expect to be so damn emotional about it!

I can heartly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for great philosophical horror sci fi story. While retaining some of the puzzle elements of the previous games.
