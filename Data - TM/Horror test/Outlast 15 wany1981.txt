Well this game is 20$ right now and it saved me more money then that....

I couldn't eat yesterday's lunch.. last night dinner and this morning's breakfast because of this game.
I would have spent more then 20$ on food and other things yesterday.. But during and after playing this game.. those money are saved...

I just couldn't stomach the food for right now and i couldn't sleep last night...

There is a chinese saying.. "尸山血海" Which is use to describe the battle field or Masscure... It's word by word meaning is "Corpse Mountain, And Blood Sea". This game literally take the meaning and produced the effect.

I only posted 1 screenshoot of this game and I had to choose one of the very basic ones and put on spoiler...
The other ones I end up deleting simply because it feels like a crime to show such graphic picture on internet to kids that may stumble upon them.

I did play Insane difficulty to start to try to get all the achievements but gave up 3 hours in cause it's just a bit too hard since you basicly playing ironman and simply cannot die even once. Just lower the difficulty by 1 would be a great experience. 17 hours marathon was enough for me to complete the main game and DLC. I am sure a lot people can do much faster if they just play on normal.

As I play this game. It immendiatly felt like the good old resident evi 2l: Nemesis. You are constantly pressured by enemy you cannot defeat and have to find way to evade, hide and use enviroment to your adavange to dodge/delay the encounter. Except this time you play a reporter(for DLC a software engineer) and unlike Jill you don't get a weapon... not a gun.. not a bat.. not even a shiv... You don't get to use a single weapon in the entire game.

All you got is camera that have infradvision for you to see in the dark.. And there are alot dark...

Graphics of this game is really not that great but creater made it super nasty and even borderline disgusting and give a grand sense of surreal terror. The way Horror game should be!

The story, dialog and interaction is great though out the base game. The DLC even improved what worked for the base game and even made it better.

There is section of full 20 seconds in DLC made me hold my balls the entire time and afraid it's gonna be table saw away...

The heavy breathing and scared sound the main character feel so real.. and as you playing the game there will be many time you feel your heart beat match the main character's heartbeat. Sometime too fast.. sometime stopped!!!

You must use everything to survive in this game and sound/music play a huge importance and it's very well done. You can just feel the big guy breathing down your neck when you being chased.

For horror Game I have always said Silent hill Series would be my No.1 because that's psychologically involved...
It still is my number one. But this game grab second very easily. It's not as story involved and intriging as silent Hill. But It will make a weak man      his pants... (I didn't .. but i did lose sleep and food over it soooo...)

9.9/10 for a Great horror Game experience... And please keep kids less then 18 away from this game..
