A truly great horror game experience that whilst it made use of jump scares, did not rely on them. An engaging story of horror, with a cast of sick and twisted individuals to torment and terrify you.

Set in an insane asylum run by a nefarious group, you play an intrepid reporter, intent on getting a great stroy. Unfortunately for you, it turns out that you are to become that great story, and your aims quickly change to a simpler one: Get Out!

There is a mix of supernatural and pseudo science that has an X Files feeling to it but at its heart this game is a classic horror experience. You don't fight, you run and you hide. Actually the hide mechanics are pretty good and the 'enemy' AI will keep you on your toes (or cowering under a bed). And the game uses an interesting mechanic in the nightvision mode of the camera. It allowed the game to cover you in darkness and yet still be able to see, albeit not very well, and having to use valuable batteries. But more importantly it somehow made the game feel more real. More like a documentary gone wrong. Something akin to the Blair Witch Project.

If you like horror games, this is a must have.
