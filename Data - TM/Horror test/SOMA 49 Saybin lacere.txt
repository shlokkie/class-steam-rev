This is not a game.. An experience such as this MUST be felt. It made me question current life views values, morals, and even my own outlook on life. No game in the past few years has forced a man who has morning shifts to power through it with such reckless interest. I constantly wanted to dive deeper, explore more, find out what happens next. SOMA is a game, but is also a story and an experience. One that you need to see and experience. One that your friend needs to experience. One that I think everyone needs to experience.

Move your cursor over to buy, click add to cart. Then click "purchase for myself". Then lock yourself in your room/office/hidey hole, and lock the door. Then proceed to turn off your lights, wear your headset/crank the volume, and question what your own consciousness is.. Welcome to SOMA.
