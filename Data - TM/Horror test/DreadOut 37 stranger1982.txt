Dreadout is an old school survival horror inspired by Indonesian ghost tales and lore: its roots and the original ghosts they spawned are the game's strong point and provide some interesting encounters that are sadly often blemished by clunky combat and a few annoying bugs.

PROS:

 great soundtrack and sound design

 original and truly disturbing ghosts

 each ghost needs a different strategy to be beaten thus keeping you on edge

 unsettling, creepy atmosphere mantained through the whole game

 extra collectibles provide background to the story

CONS:

 below average graphics even on High settings, textures are quite blurry

 wooden animations

 combat feels clunky due to the time it takes to bring the camera up and the slow first person speed

 boss battles alternate between easy and frustrating

 little character depth

 a few situations can be confusing due to not following the usual rules or not being properly hinted at (e.g. having to use the flash at a certain location, having to actually die at a certain point etc)

 the whole story is never properly explained and, after the end, you're left wondering what exactly happened and why

 despite being a year old and several patches there's still quite a few annoying bugs and while they're not gamebreaking they sure are annoying. I experienced achievements not unlocking properly, camera hits not registering on enemies and a couple scenes not playing properly: all those were solved by a checkpoint reload but the fact they're still in the game shows poor programming



Despite my grievances with it Dreadout is still a pretty decent, if not good, game: the various ghosts are all pretty interesting and, while more unsettling than truly scary, work pretty nicely in keeping you under pressure. The atmosphere is pretty strong and will make you feel uneasy and threatened most of the time.

We never got Fatal Frame on PC so this can work as a poor man's substitute if the Cons list hasn't disheartened you too much: just wait for a 50% or more sale.
