Honestly, SOMA is one of the best games I've ever played.

When playing non multiplayer games I tend to completely immerse myself in the game world, forget my real surroundings. That's why I have never played a horror game and did not intend to ever touch one   I can't handle that stress. But then Frictional Games announced SOMA. Being a big enthusiast of the concept of Artificial Consciousness, the themes Frictional showed off two years ago got me very, very interested in the game to the point I kinda ignored it's a horror game the best I could.

Now, that the game's finally released, I couldn't ignore it being a horror game anymore. What's worse: forcing myself to actually play a horror game for the first time in my life even though I don't like them; or not experiencing the game based on my favorite themes in person that I waited two years for.

It took a great bit of struggle, and it was by far the most terrifying experience I've ever had, but I played SOMA from start to finish the way it was meant to be played (alone at night etc), and god I'm glad I forced myself through it. Even though I developed unreasonable expectations over the time prior to launch, they were all met. I wasn't disappointed, in fact, I was surprised at how great the experience was (apart from the horror). I really enjoyed the atmosphere, I loved the world it's set in (there are so many awesome things about Pathos II it's unbelievable), and, most importantly, I was amazed by the story.

I still keep coming back to SOMA, keep thinking about it. I even decided to replay the first few parts recently because I love being in Pathos II so much. In my opinion, the way SOMA ended does allow a further continuation of the story, and I really hope Frictional does something with it. I need more SOMA.

TLDR: WAU that was good.
