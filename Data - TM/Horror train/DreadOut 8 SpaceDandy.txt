First of all, I've got to admit that I appreciate what the devs are trying to do, especially seeing all these bland, boring post amnesia and post slender horror games. DreadOut is not just a collection of jumpscares and definitely not a "get out from the creepy labyrinth while a monster is chasing you" kind of thing. It has a story to tell, puzzles to solve, a bunch of different monsters with backstories, it offers some variety and even something that reminds a battle system, so it's more like "big" horror games of the past decade. Too bad that the experience itself felt frustrating for me. The "battle system" where you need to take photos of monsters is messy (although you get used to it after a while), there are glitches here and there, monster designs are not scary (moreover, I couldn't help but laugh in some "scary" scenes), puzzles sometimes feel too cryptic, Act 2 has a totally different pacing than Act 1 and... I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I wasn't scared at all, had only one or two moments when I felt somehow creepy. Despite of all this, the game has interesting ideas in both gameplay and story   and I totally loved the talk scene from the Act 2, DreadOut at its best. I wish there were more moments like that. I guess the reason for most of the problems is lack of experience of the devs, they're small indie team after all. 
Overall, honestly, I don't know if I can recommend this game or not, I have really mixed feelings about it. If some interesting ideas, great OST (totally going to buy it) and badass ending are enough for you to bear frustrating gameplay elements, you can buy it, it's most likely that you won't regret your decision. But I'll give it "Yes" because it tries to do something different in the genre.
Hope my post was useful; it's my first time writing a proper game review in English.
