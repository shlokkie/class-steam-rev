Games don't scare me. Movies don't scare me. In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by... except Amnesia. Why? Because in this game, I am powerless. I cannot fight back. Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc.; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits. Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them. But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction. Those creepers waiting to pop out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though... My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does. Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12.
