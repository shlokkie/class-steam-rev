A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged.

Amnesia is an old school horror experience where it is what you can't quite see that terrifies you more than what you can see. It puts you on the edge of madness and terror and keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.

The story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman suffering amnesia, stumbling around a dark castle searching for answers. But those answer are unlikely to bring you joy. However whilst the story is horrific enough, the true brilliance of this game is the way it injects you with a feeling of utter helplessness and despair. You never feel like you have any options other than to run and hide, and even those options feel temporary, simply putting off the inevitable for a little longer. And yet run and hide you do.

And no game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. So you flit from light to dark, never able to truly feel comfortable in either.

Everything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear. The sound and the visuals are great and the game mechanics are actually very cool. Pushing and pulling items around, moving chairs in front of doors, it all works to give that genuine horror movie experience.

If you like horror games this is a must have. And I dare you to play it at night, with the lights off and headphones one :)

I recorded my full play through and you can watch it here :
