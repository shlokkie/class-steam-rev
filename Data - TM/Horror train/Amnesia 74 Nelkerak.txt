As one of the only people who wasn't introduced to this game via pewdiepie, I love this game like a son. The atmosphere, controls and gameplay all just fit together like a big ol' jigsaw puzzle.

10/10, make sure to have skype friends with you on your way so they can laugh at your fear.

EDIT: I should also add: there are no devious, unexpected jumpscares except one which occurs really late into the game when you should already be hardened by what you've seen so far.
