"Outlast" is a terrifying survival horror game in which you play as a journalist named Miles Upshur. You are directed towards the location of a mental hospital called "Mount Massive Asylum". As you sneak in to the building, you start to see that horrific stuff is happening there. You then go on a shocking journey to find out what is going on in this place. Anyways, the game has a great atmosphere and soundtrack, the enemies and scares are terrifying as hell, and the gameplay can be quite fun. The story is mediocre, but the ending is bad and could've been made better, (it's forgivable because the game is scary as hell and still fun to play). One of the best horror games that have been released lately. Try this awesome survival horror game out for yourself.
