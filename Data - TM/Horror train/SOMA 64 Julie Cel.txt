I'm nearly 10 hours in, and too terrified to continue at the moment.

What can I say?

It's a long awaited game that makes me pretty proud to call myself a frictional fan. The game incorporates all the different horror scenarios I crave yet fear the most. Patroling monsters, emotional game choices and a really messed up storyline that makes you weigh your curiosity for the truth over your fear of playing... most of the time. Dynamic areas   there's so much variety in the places you go, very visually stimulating.

The only thing I was left wanting for   Some sort of objective or journal feature. Games like this force me to walk away from my computer pretty often ! So having some sort of mission objective would be really handy for when I return.

Thank You guys for delivering !
