Let me start off by saying this; as someone who doesn't usually play scary games, this was an extremely satisfying experience for me. And the fact that it was created by indie developers makes me wonder why all indie developers don't make games of this standard. They did get funding, however it is still a very high quality game. Well done to the producers too, they made this game very scary, but not so scary that people wouldn't buy it because of the fear level. Now onto my opinions of this game. As you can probably already tell, I'm a fan of this game. I loved every second of it, the excitement, the fear, the horror. I do agree with people who say this game could've been way more horrifying, but at the same time I feel like the developers got it right with the plot, difficulty, build up to scary moments etc. I also really liked the notes and documents system and the variety in the enemies (variants). Now with the Whistleblower DLC, I really want to say I enjoyed it more than the main game, but I'm just not sure about it. But for a horror game, it has an excellent story. The story and exploration mixed with the notes and documents made me feel like I was immersed in every situation, which, I think, the developers of all horror games should strive for. All in all, Outlast is a very pleasurable encounter for those of you that enjoy being frightened so much that your mind will scream in affliction and writhe in agony due to the malevolent nature of this game. 8.5/10
