Outlast is a true horror game. This game scared me more often than many horror films to date. If you want to experience the fear and adrenaline of running through dark hallways with an injured leg while being chased by men that can only be described as nightmares incarnate, then you must play this game. There are plenty of horrific characters you meet along the way and a false sense of hope around every corner and at each door. Please, do yourself a favor and play this EXPERIENCE. As a sidenote i just finished the dlc Whistleblower and it was well executed too. I give this game a 10/10.
