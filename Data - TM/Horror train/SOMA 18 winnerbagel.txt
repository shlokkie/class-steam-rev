Frictional Games has done it again. They have created another fantastic horror game that was well worth the wait. It far exceeded my expectations, and I believe it raised the bar for horror games as a whole.

The story is incredibly immersive and left me scratching my head and reflecting on ideas in a way I have never thought about. The atmosphere is top notch, owing to the detailed environments and incredible sound design. The sounds in the game are so varied and delivered so well that you will often stop and listen to see if the noises are actual threats or just from the environment.

Despite what some people may say, this is definitely NOT a walking simulator like AAMFP was. I found it pretty challenging at times, with enemy AI surpassing TDD by quite a bit. The creatures you try to evade will be able to hear you much easier, and they won't just disappear this time around.

I can say without a doubt that this is the best horror game I have ever played. If you're a fan of real horror games, this game deserves to be in your library.
