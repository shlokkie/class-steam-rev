ACT ONE
DreadOut is very different from the horror games that has been released the last couple of years, the game itself reminds me of Fatal Frame and Siren Blood Curse (PS3), they are both very good games. Now this game comes around taking a bit of everything and creates a very nice horror game. The graphics are not that great, the texture quality on Linda and the other characters are fine, but the ground, cars and even the walls seems like something from the Playstation 2 era, but graphics are not all. 

The game itself is very enjoyable, the horror is made just right and the game is made with creepy in mind instead of cheap jump scares everywhere. You still think the school is creepy even when you know there is nothing in that room or you already walked around there without anything happening and sometimes you can hear stuff going on even when you can't see it or near it. 

You can even play act one more than once, cause I even discovered that it's not worth rushing though, you can search the city at night and find stuff here and there.
With act one with less than two hours long, I still think this is worth the money. This game and games like OutLast is here to change horror to where it belongs.
