Certainly a good horror game to play if you're ever craving that "old school" feel. I love the fact that this game doesn't breadcrumb the way to your objectives and simply provides hints. There's also a good deal of new "ghosts" for those who are used to only seeing japanese ghosts and the like.

I'm sure you will also enjoy this game if you decide to open your mind and give it a chance!
