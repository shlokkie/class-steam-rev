   "Worth your time, give it a bash" 

PROS:
  Outlast is without a shadow of a doubt the scariest game I have ever played.
  It sets a perfect tone, its wickedly atmospheric and the scares are perfectly crafted
  The gore is graphically wonderful, as are the disturbing characters you meet along the way
  Switched between camera night vision to reserve battery creates great tension whilst exploring

CONS:
  A recycled corny storyline/setting

VERDICT?
Its a tough ending to take but the journey to get there was a brilliant experience which is well worth putting yourself through if you think you can handle it...
