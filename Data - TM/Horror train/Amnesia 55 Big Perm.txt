This was the first Horror game I've played and I fell in love with it. The music, the sounds, the atmosphere all make this game a gem. I felt there was a good balance of scariness and they didnt try too throw it in your face. The lore was good as well as the puzzles. Best part about this game are all the story mods you can get. Just a ton of other great stories and scares to get for free.
