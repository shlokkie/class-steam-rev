Competent, Unadulterated Survival Horror

+ Atmosphere is palpable and relentless
+ The 'insanity' feature is well integrated into the game's environment, and the restrictive nature of needing to stay within a light source adds a challenging mechanic to one's adventure
+ The little voice acting present in the game is superb in quality
+ Graphics and textures, though dated, have aged well
+ Level designs are well planned and make one feel thoroughly immersed
+ Controls are smooth, responsive, and blissfully minimalist
+ The story has multiple endings to choose from, and they differ enough as to be worth seeing
+ The plot is interesting and incredibly well delivered
+ Pages and mementos are well worth the effort to obtain, and do well to enrich the experience
+ Supports custom story quests

  Save for a drive to see the other endings, there is little incentive to replay the main quest
  Plot is advanced through linear exploration and fetch quests; this does not necessarily detract from the experience, and indeed this was the intended method of gameplay, but gamers uncomfortable with this style may find themselves turning away from the game due to an underlying tedium
