I would reccomend this game but one big warning that barely anyone seems to mention. YOU CANNOT LOAD YOUR SAVES! That, to me, is a huge deal since I can't always just sit down and play an entire game in one go. If they fix that, I'd probably give the game a good review.

Some people say the graphics are ok, and I'm fine with them. The majority of the gameplay is ok   but some things could be tweaked. There are times if you're hit, you're going to lose because the enemy can constantly hit you and knock you down over and over again before you can even get up to move. 

The story isn't bad but I think it also could use with some fixing so people could understand a little more of what's going on, if they wanted it to be somewhat vague   that's fine then I suppose. 

If I could give this a neutral review I probably would. I wouldn't reccomend buying it at full price, when it's on sale is more acceptable.
