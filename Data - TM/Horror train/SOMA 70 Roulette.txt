TL;DR: A++ so far   would submit to robot overlords again.

Soma is incredibly atmospheric. The plot will have you wondering which reality is the real one, and sounds alone will send you on alarm. The sudden jolting change in setting is very effective.

Pros:
+Sound!!! So Rich
+Graphics are moody and immersive
+Plot is intriguing and hooks you from the start with the mystery
+Characters feel human and well developed

Cons:
+Load times are on the high end
+Amnesia controls do not feel any more refined, drawers can still be clunky to open etc.


I will update this more as I play.
