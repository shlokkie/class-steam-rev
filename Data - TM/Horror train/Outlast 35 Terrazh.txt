Outlast is a great game in almost every way, from tension to graphics.

Pros:
  Amazing atmosphere.
  Great graphics.
  Sound is fantastic.
  The camera is a well implemented part of the game, making the search for batteries yet another tense part of the game.
  You have no weapons   your only option is to run.
  The environment is amazing.
  The Whistleblower DLC is a nice touch to the story.

Cons:
  The maps are big and can be confusing, but I'm not sure if that's even a con, given that you have some sense of exploration.
  It can have a repetitive nature. It can quickly turn into a hide and seek simulator, if you have no idea how to progress through the level.
  The character design is not well developed or in depth. 

All in all, I can deeply recommend Outlast. The cons are nothing compared to the great parts of Outlast, and you should definitely buy it, if you enjoy the genre.
