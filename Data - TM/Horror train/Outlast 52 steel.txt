I can't really generalize and say that Outlast is not scary, but if you're a veteran of horror games, then most likely it will not scare you a lot. It's linear, easy (even on harder levels of difficulty) and short (3 to 4 hours). It's forgiving due to frequent and well placed checkpoints. It's pretty straightforward so you can't really go the wrong way. Also your enemies can't outrun you and unless you make horrible mistakes, you're invincible. THOUGH the games has a pretty good atmosphere and setting and is fun to play despite all the flaws that it obviously has. Outlast tells a very deep story, which is quite hard to catch the first time you're playing. Speaking of the ending.. I personally find it a little non authentic and I expected something else, though this doesn't really affect the final score. Outlast is a good game that I can recommend. 7.5/10
