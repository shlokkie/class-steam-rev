Whenever I feel nervous or anxious I play this relaxing game to calm my nerves. I especially recommend playing this before going to sleep as it will ensure a good night's sleep for you! The overall atmosphere of this game is very cheerful and bright. The maps are filled with great landscapes, ingenious architecture, and friendly creatures and characters. In my opinion it's exciting and constant entertainment for all ages and genders. A great game in every aspect and 100% worth the money! The only con is that a character known as 'brute' is sometimes very naughty.
