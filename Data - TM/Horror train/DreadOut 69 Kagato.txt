Do you like Fatal Frame? Then you'll love this game. There are a few negatives, though:

 Boss Ghosts (one in particular) are difficult to the point of near unfairness.
 There's one sequence you're randomly thrown into with no clear direction on what to do and how to escape while being chased. However, if you're caught and lose a life, you respawn with nothing chasing you anymore, just leaving you without a threat and the same lack of direction. Hint: Use your camera to find a hidden path.
 Too short. It's being released in 'episodes' so there's far more to come, but the main game released so far and all it's secrets will only last about 2 3 hours.

Despite the negatives that will no doubt be addressed later, this game is very much a fun Fatal Frame sister title and is one of the few indie horror games that I have found to be AAA quality.
