Certainly one of the best science fiction adventure games ever made. Highly recommended.

✔ Excellent game engine, interesting lighting effects
✔ Excellent soundtracks (by the fantastic Mikko Tarmia) and perfect sound design!
✔ Excellent story
✔ Excellent level and environment design
✔ Good voice acting (although not very diverse accent wise) despite an average dialogue writing
✔ Very decent longevity
✔ Linux support! Excellent port by Aaron Melcher of Knockout Games

✘ Lacks plausibiliy in places (many things looks overly simplified)
✘ Some details lack consistency and complexity
