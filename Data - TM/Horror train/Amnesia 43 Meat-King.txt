"To him who is in fear everything rustles."

Amnesia: The Dark Descent lives up to its title in providing a captivating gameplay and intriguing storyline. The music and sound effects complement each other perfectly, enhancing the immersive horror atmosphere within the ancient castle walls you travel, while solving puzzles. As already introduced in the Penumbra series of games, your only means of defense are hiding, running or using the environment to your advantage, leaving you with a sense of helplessness on your journey of self discovery.

Fun fact: With more than 1.4 million sales Amnesia: The Dark Descent represents the biggest financial success of the Swedish video game company Frictional Games.
