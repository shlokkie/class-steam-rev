as an Indonesian, i found that act 1 is not that scary. i've seen worse before in real life lol.
but the act 2, that was just released a few days ago, is really freakin scary.
the developer managed to built the haunting atmosphere with ethnical music, clothes and myth properties. somehow it succeeded scaring me intensely (try playing it with headphone guys). 
also the survival aspects make it even better, geared with only phone's flashlight and SLR camera.
the sound is the best part here, sometimes you can hear strange voices come out of a sudden. the puzzles are also pretty nice.

so overall
+ great atmosphere
+ the side missions are decent
+ love the puzzles
+ the sound is the best aspect
+ ghosts have detailed information

  mediocre storyline
  graphics are meh
  performance issues (FPS dropped when dozens of tuyul appeared  _ )
  too short, we want moarrrrrr!!!
  the environment is too small

P.S. : linda is so hawt man, would bang 69/10
