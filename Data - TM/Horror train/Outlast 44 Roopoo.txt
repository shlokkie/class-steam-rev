I certainly didn't Out last this one.

Rather unfortunately, my game was abruptly ended after just over an hour (some giant spasm ran down my arm, causing my fist to smash down on the PC's reset button whilst my other hand mashed Alt+F4... I should really see a doctor about that.)


In all seriousness, the tension in Outlast is ramped up to MAX. 
A perfect example of a psychological thriller, with all bases covered.


The atmosphere is incredibly eerie, borderline terrifying!
Armed with only a Night Vision camera inside an insane asylum, you're up for some serious competition against your imagination and whatever may lurk within...


Tldr;

For any who suffer from IBS, a weak heart or insomnia, I really don't recommend playing this game unless you have access to methods of medical treatment (seriously.)
My wrecked nervous system says run away and don't come back.

For those that are fans of the Thriller genre, in no way claustrophobic, and have a limitless supply of underwear to hand   my inner thirst for self torture says 'Go for it!'


(To your own mental detriment.)

I believe my brain may be screwed.
