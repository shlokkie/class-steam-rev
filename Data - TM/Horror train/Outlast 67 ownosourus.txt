Red Barrels have done a fantastic job combining an intensely disquieting setting, a unique visual look, and an incredibly effective camera gimmick to ensure that nobody escapes Mount Massive without a few nightmares.Outlast is terrifying, brutal and crazy. The story is clever enough to assemble all themes into a complete picture and tie it with some historical facts, but the most important thing is this: Outlast is really scary. Honestly, no game before has made me feel such strong emotions. Outlast is a must buy for all fans of scary stories. Outlast is a game designed to frighten even those who deem themselves hard to scare. What we have here is a proper survival horror game that thankfully doesn't make the transition to the action genre like so many other horror themed games these days.Outlast's combination of stealth, platforming and horror is exceptional, the benefits of the diverse experience of its highly talented development team always in plain sight. Outlast hits most of its objectives, serving as head of a new series for the horror subjective.
