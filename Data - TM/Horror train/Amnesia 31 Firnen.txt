Are you looking for a game that is different than all those other horror games out there? Well, you don't need to look further; Amnesia: The Dark Descent is that game. This game is truly horrifying, unlike most horror games out there, Amnesia isn't a horror game that is full of cheap jump scares. Amnesia: the Dark Descent is that game you shouldn't be focused on playing the game to win; you should be focused on being submerged into this big, dark, and petrifying world. Amnesia's scares are ones that last, making your hands shake and evermore aware of your surroundings. These long lasting scares, however, are evenly put out with the unique puzzles in the game. Nothing ever feels better when you solve an elaborate puzzle, and move onward to the next. You cannot fight your enemies; you should either run like hell, or hide. From solving puzzles, dodging monsters, and keeping an eye on your sanity. Every chamber just takes you ever deeper into the abyss of what's called Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

Is the Main Story too scary? Or are you bored of it? Don't think that you're done yet, because the horror doesn't end there. You can go online and download custom stories, made by users to scare other users and to make the Amnesia experience a better one.
