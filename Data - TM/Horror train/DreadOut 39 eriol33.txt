maybe because I'm an indonesian, these ghosts are not that scary enough (they are frequently used in cheap B movies). however people from different country may be enjoy the thrill more than I do (I find ghosts from other asian countries are scarier than the ones in my country.)

The atmosphere is creepy, but not incredibly scary. Could have used creepier, atmospheric music. 

the only thing annoy me in this game is probably the game over sequence.

EDIT: Just saw some screenshots from the act 2, I may revise my comments of being not scared later on.
