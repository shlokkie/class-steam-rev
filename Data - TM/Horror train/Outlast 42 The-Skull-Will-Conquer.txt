Ok let me start of by saying that i have loved the "survival horror" genre of games for some time and i must admit that i walked into this ones with my eyes open expecting it to neither A  frighten me or B  SHOCK me and to be honest it did both at some point in this game but their was one scene in particular (wont say what as it will really spoil that moment for you) that i still havent forgotten about now.
Now when you start the game you will notice that you have no weapon just a camera and an urge to discover the truth behind the information you have been sent and for this sort of game that pays dividends as you really do need to play the game and observe and listen and eventually it all makes sense.
The graphics in this game do their job perfectly and the sound also plays a heavy factor (and does its job perfectly too) in creating a very forboding and oppresive attmosphere.Let me say that a lot of people have been saying that there are a lot of games at the moment that leave you defenceless and you are allways having to hide (dare i mention a classic here AMNESIA) but for this sort of game it makes complete sense,honestly in the real world is there a gun and ammunition lying around on every street corner "NO",so in this game it makes sense and makes an allready scary game (my opinion) even more of an edge of your seat experienece.
Like i say its better not to explain to much on story details as it would ruin the whole thing lets just say this when you see the first guy and he speaks to you,you know where the game is headed and what sort of experience you will have (a solitary one and one you wont forget that easily) OH AND THE HEADS EERRGGHH,and lets just hope we get a sequel as the ending just begs explanation and also i am eager to get back to "MOUNT MASSIVE ASYLUM" myself and take my MEDICINE again.

(NEW DLC "WHISTLE BLOWER" OUT SO WILL BE ADDING THIS TO THE REVIEW WHEN I GET AROUND TO PLAYING IT)
