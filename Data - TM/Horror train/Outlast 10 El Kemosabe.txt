Outlast is a survival horror game that takes place in the Mount Massive Asylum. You are Miles Upshur, a journalist who has come to Mount Massive having received an email from someone within the facility (the main character in Whistleblower) which raised concerns about the safety of the facility and Murkoff, the company who run it. You will not encounter any scary monsters in this game, those who you run from are men, twisted by Murkoff. 

A word of warning, this game is extremely graphic and contains some very disturbing scenes, this game is absolutely not appropriate for a younger audience.

+Gorgeous graphics which help add to the immersion of the game
+Interesting setting
+Truly terrifying and not just because of the jumpscares but because of the atmosphere of the game
+The game's sound design is fantastic and helps contribute to the above point
+You cannot fight what you come across in the asylum, you can only run and hide
+Unpredictable enemies makes the game even more scary
+Intense chase scenes
+Outstanding voice acting adds to the immersion of the game
+Some very interesting characters
+The 'people' you come across in the asylum who were once patients feel very real, mainly due to their unpredictability and the voice acting, and it really helps add to the immersiveness and atmosphere of the game

+/ Some very graphic and disturbing scenes, some may find these too much but I feel they help to add to the realism of the game
+/ You don't have time to catch your breath as there are no parts of this game where a scare isn't lurking around the corner

 Very little replay value
 You're gonna need more underwear

Verdict:
9

An outstanding horror experience made great by its atmosphere and characters more than anything. A must have for survival horror fans.
