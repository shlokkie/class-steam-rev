This game made me think about alot of things, i thought amnesia     ed me over hard but holy crap you guys really out did yourself with this game. This game has everything interesting story and gameplay that will chill your core. I have never played a game that made me so uncomforable, so scared of every little sound and have me overthink everythign and hide like a baby. I wish I could say more about the story but all im gonna say is go into thsi game blind, not knowing anything, alone at night with no one around but yourself. Believe me this will really scare the      out of you so badly to make you wanna stop playing. I just wish this game would never end but all good things come to an end and this game was one hell of a ride and makes you think what it means to truely be human. Thank you Frictional Games for making this game, more games should be like this and you guys set the example of what a true horror game should really be.
