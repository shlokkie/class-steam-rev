A trully masterpiece. 11/10.

Best horror/storytelling game I've ever played.

In this game you have the opportunity to:
1. Press shift key so hard that your finger hurts trying to run faster;
2. Stand still for lots of minutes hoping the monster will disappear;
3. Live a story you never really thought about;
4. Realize how     ed up item 3 is;
5. Try to find a new understanding of existence because of item 4;
6. End the game and stay on item 5 for undetermined time.

Also a better love story than Twilight.
