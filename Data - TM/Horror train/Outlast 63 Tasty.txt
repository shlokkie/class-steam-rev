Outstanding horror game and one of the best to come out in recent years since Amnesia as far as I'm concerned. Very immersive experience with a true horror feel. Runs very well on PC and looks fantastic. Plot takes somewhat of a backseat but it is compelling nonetheless. Definitely pick this one up if you like survival horror as this one is a gem of the genre.
