A very good game indeed, very creepy with some real scares. The game also has some of the most surreal moments I have seen in a long time. I enjoyed the exploration in the game, its gives you a certian amount of freedom to look around and pick items up. The game has real malevolent atmosphere that is really effective.I do hope people buy it and support these developers, I was surpised to find no bugs in the game, it was solid, I have played modern titles that have had terrible bugs in them, yet a game like this comes along and for me was bug free. its nice to see games like this being developed for the PC. I really enjoyed it and hope other gamers will give this title a try its well worth your time and money.
