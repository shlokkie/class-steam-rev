As a big fan of the "Fatal Frame" series, I was really anxious to get my hands on "DreadOut". I mean, c'mon…fighting ghosts with nothing but a camera? It may sound silly to the uninitiated, but those who have played "Fatal Frame" know better. "DreadOut" is a more modern day version of "Fatal Frame" where the player takes on the role of Linda, a high school student trapped in an old abandoned town. Equipped only with a smart phone, she'll (you'll) be tasked with solving puzzles all the while fending off some really terrifying "creatures". 

Buying the game will grant you access to the first act, with DLC on the second act and a free roam mode to follow. My biggest gripe is that Act One is only about one and a half to two hours long, once you know what you're doing. There's only a handful of ghosts to boot. Just as I was getting into the first act, it was over…I didn't have this problem with "Outlast", which took between five to ten hours to complete. I was able to confirm with the developer that the second act will be free, though the free roam DLC will have a price tag. I was also able to confirm with the developer that the second act will contain more content than the first, so that helped to alleviate some of my concerns somewhat with regard to the price. 

Besides the "buy Act One now and hope Act Two is more meaty" feeling, I did run into a bug or two. The game can also glitch out on occasion, forcing you to hard quit and replay areas already beaten. One of my save files got corrupted and I had to erase it altogether. Still, "Dread Out" is an incredible and horrifying experience. There is a demo available should you wish to try before you buy. If you can't get through the first minute of a "Slender" game without screaming like a little girl, then you may want to before dropping the dough.
