Great atmosphere and story so far. Really like how you actually have time to experience the story and actually pay attention to the notes and various details. Unlike Amnesia: The Dark Descent you are just constantly running around and just doing puzzles but story does not get through, in SOMA the story is rich enough so that it does not have to be stretched like a rubber band in previous Amnesia games. The narrative relies on 2 parts, just the main story line and you figuring out puzzles and various side narrative puzzles that help you understand the world even better.

The game can definatly be scary and spooky but its just the right amount of down time and scary time. Since if a game is so stressful all the time like Amnesia The Dark Descent, instead of feeling like "man what an awesome game", you feel like "man I'm such a hero for finishing such a scary game, but not truly appreciating the game as a whole". With SOMA you feel like it is a seamless experience and puzzles, atmosphere and the scares have a good flow to them. I also like how this game does not rely on jump scares but is still scary during encounters.

Another great factor is that different creatures/monsters give you different types of scares. Which is again unlike Amnesia is not OMG thats the Grunt run run run, or the actual nightmare monster run run run. Even though they are different monsters they feel the same. In SOMA the distinction is there which is awesome for variety and experience.
