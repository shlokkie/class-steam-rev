Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that only comes around once all of the planets in our solar system align perfectly   which, is to say, never. But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit.

... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia   there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.

It's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.
