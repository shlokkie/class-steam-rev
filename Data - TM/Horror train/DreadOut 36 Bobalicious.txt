Dreadout's first humanoid ghost is the scariest encounter I've had in a game so far.

I'm 27, and I've played all of Fatal Frame, Silent Hill, STALKER, Resident Evil, White Day, Metro 2033/LL, Siren, AvP, Dead Space, Condemned, Amnesia, and Ecco.

NOTHING has gotten me like that ghost got me. I knew it was coming from a mile away, and all I could do was let it      me while I screamed and my neighbors threatened to complain.

This      will make your balls jump into your throat.
