Soma was a truly incredible experience for me. From start to finish it kept my attention, and constantly made me think. Think about the story, about the characters, the situation, and most importantly, about what it means to be human. It's a very appealing theme for a video game that I haven't seen in games before (although I do realize there have been many films/books made about the topic).

Made by Frictional games, the same developers of Amnesia the Dark Descent, I had high expectations for pretty much everything. They didn't let me down. The new HPL 3 Engine looks amazing, and gave me some of the most atmospheric moments I've ever had in gaming. The sound design is top notch, and the voice actors are definitely worth commending. Although there aren't many characters in the game, those that do feature, pull off incredible performances.

Although the game had several scary moments, I personally found one part towards the end of the game absolutely terrifying. It's safe to say that I really enjoyed the pacing of the game and how everything became particularly more intense as I progressed.

Probably the only criticism I can make is the length of the game, which I felt was a bit short. A lot of reviewers criticized the puzzles, but I personally enjoyed them all for the most part.

Soma is definitely worth playing if you enjoy survival horror. But even if you're new to survival horror, I'm certain you'll find this game worthwhile.
