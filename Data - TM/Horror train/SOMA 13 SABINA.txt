Absolute genius.

Frictional is at the top of their game with this masterpiece. Continuing their tradition of innovating the horror genre that began with the seminal Penumbra and Amnesia titles, games that have inspired so many since, with Soma they have achieved nothing less than inventing a new genre for gaming: Existential Horror.

Soma has all the hallmarks of great horror; atmosphere aplenty, immersive sound, suspense and tension, shocks and scares. They had already achieved mastery over these elements in games that so many have borrowed from. But Soma introduces another element, something deeper and more truly horrifying than almost anything imaginable. It delves into the human psyche and threatens it's very core needs. It identifies the fundaments of who and what we are, then takes them away. This can potentially cause an existential crisis in the contemplative mind. What other vehicle of media can claim that? Perhaps some movies and great works of fiction touch upon it, but the closest I've ever been to such a feeling is upon waking from a nightmare.

Get it. Play it. Feel it. It's ok if you need to call your Mommy afterwards.
