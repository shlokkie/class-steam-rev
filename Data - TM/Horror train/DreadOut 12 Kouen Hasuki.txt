A survival horror game in which the protagonist, on a field trip that took a wrong turn in Mentalville, discovers an abandoned village and school with her classmates and increasingly ineffective teacher.

Cue classmate getting possessed, everyone getting locked into the abandoned school and separated, and you have your game story. 

Effectively scary, but sadly, suffering from some performance issues and the like, there's still a fair bit about this game to like.

Enjoy!

Kouen & Lasharus rate this game 7.1 / 10
