SHORT VERSION: Great game. Crazy disturbing, but not too many jump scares. Buy it.

END SHORT VERSION.

PROS:

 Superbly detailed graphics. Ran buttery smooth at 60fps on my machine. Sometimes I just liked to walk into empty rooms and stare at them, they are so amazingly specific. Devs captured the "night vision infared camera" look perfectly.
 Convincing atmosphere. Played this game at night with the headphones on and the lights off and after 20 minutes I felt like that dude in Tron when he got sucked into the game.
 Genre pushing visuals. Saw things in this game (and the dlc) that I NEVER saw in any other game, ever: HOLY CRAP, DUDE WTF AM I LOOKING AT??? IS THAT GUY tenderly caressing A willing adult partner IN THE agreed upon location ??????? AAAAARRRRGH WHERE IS THE "UNSEE" BUTTON???????

CONS: 
 another one of those "run, hide or die" stealth games. No weapons, anywhere. Problem for me was there wasn't enough variation; running and hiding through the entire game got a little boring sometimes. Wished I could I pull off a stealth melee kill at least once in a while, just for a little variation and pace change. Admittedly, though, most folks will be too scared out of their mind to agree with me on that point.


10/10   would calmly play this in the near future again
