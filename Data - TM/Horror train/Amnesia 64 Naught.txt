You will need to have a defibrillator at hand when playing. I warn you now. Luckily my dad works at the hospital :D
This game made me      myself like 50 times. It was so scary I wish I could stop playing But so addictive and fascinating I never was able too. I know I have only a few steam hours at the moment but I have had about 20 hours in the non steam version. Finding out the dark mysteries and storyline is absolute fun and one of the best written stroylines ever in my opinion. Best amnesia game too. And the game is old but still amazing with even many fun concepts that I havent seen before in most games. Like throwing a table infront of the door to stop the shadow getting in and mutilating you. It may seem simple but it still amazes me.
9/10 Definitley worth it aslong as you dont mind having your bladder permanently loosened in fear.
