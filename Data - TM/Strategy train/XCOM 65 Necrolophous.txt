New version of XCOM is really great game. As a fan of original games, I was really afraid what will be this new version. This is really good example how to do new version of classic title. Some people complain that this XCOM is simplified in comparison to original title. It's true, but in that way they removed a lot of annoying details like micro managment.
They did new version as it should be done in XXI century but there is still the spirit of original title.

VERDICT:
If you are openminded fan of the serie, grab it and play it right now! It's worth of your time.
If you don't know the serie, but you just like playing good games, play it!
If you are fan of the original serie and you think that everything after XCOM: Terror From the Deep which has XCOM in the title is a blasphemy, don't touch this!
