Hours and Weeks of gaming thrills and fun. Really addictive!!!
You are the commander of a military force who fight an alian invasion on Earth. You have to build your base, research and develope new tech based on alien tech, do post mortems on aliens (Ewww!) , fight them in mission after mission .
You can name and personalize your soldiers, and the character developement is great.
This is a new game in the old X Com style, but not the same (Why should it be ?? The old games are already there !!??!!! ) . There are of course stuff from the old games I would like to see included . But it is a fabulous game as it is   So if you are thinking of "to buy or not to buy"   Just buy it :))))
Save the Earth! It`s the only planet with Chocolate!! ;)
