XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn based tactical RPG, which can be played in single player campaign mode or in multiplayer mode. Released in 2012 and using the UE3 Engine, Enemy Unknown takes place in a future where aliens have invaded earth and you are the last line of defense. As the commander, you direct soldiers turn based style to eliminate alien threats, secure objectives, and more. At the end of each mission, prior to the start of the next, you have the ability to use do research, and create new technologies, as well as handle your finances.

Visually, I think the game looks pretty good for being 3 years old. The fog of war is well done, and there are multiple difficulty settings to give players even more of a challenge. I played on Impossible mode, as well as Ironman mode, with all the special features turned on to make the game as challenging as possible and it worked. The AI is great and can present a challenge to those who rush in, forcing you to actually use tactics to clear objectives. Enemy Unknown also has an expansion called, XCOM: Enemy Within, which adds a variety of content. The Elite Edition contains all DLC Content and is the best deal if you are interested in picking up this game. I'm not a huge fan of turn based gameplay, but this is actually a really great game, nicely done, and worth paying for.
