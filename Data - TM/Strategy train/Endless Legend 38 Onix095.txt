If you like Civilization style TBS*, but want more depth and strategy, as well as much more unique races and the option to create your own race, this is the game for you.
I have played Civ:BE, and I honesty regret pre ordering that game before playing Endless Legend, Civ:BE is nothing compared to this game.

*TBS not RTS, thank you Sahuagin.
