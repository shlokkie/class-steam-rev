Endless Legend is one of those happy cases where the good impressions have resulted in an excellent game. Not among those that penalize the most complex products because they are not suitable for the mass audience, we can not help but reward him, pointing out a couple of problems that still exist, and which do not allow him to achieve excellence: the AI is little aggressive, even in the higher difficulty levels, making it unpredictable at times, too much other; random generation of maps and the need to amass troops suffered the first assaults, can create an initial disadvantage that makes it advisable to start the game in search of better luck. For the rest I suggest Endless Legend unconditionally, especially if you love the genre 4X, buying it because you will get hundreds of hours of excellent turn based strategy.
