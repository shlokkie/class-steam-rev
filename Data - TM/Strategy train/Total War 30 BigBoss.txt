Highly dissapointed. Buggy, glitchy, and crashes all the time. Turn based elements are not nearly as good as original rome. As for the battles, while they do look good, they always end up in a mosh pit brawl with stratigic and tactical decisions having little weight. The sadest thing is I could write paragraph after paragraph about what is wrong with this game and only have a few good things to say. I would not reccomend buying this game in its current state. 

Edit: Yeah I have a lot of hours on record. I payed money for the game, so why would I not try to get some value out of it? Also, before the earlier patches end turn wait time lasted anywhere between 5 7 minutes on average. Lots of time was spent afk while the ai in game took its sweet time figuring out what exactly the worst possible decision it could make would be. So yeah im dissapointed, I had higher expectations for the product on release. Just because im dissapointed doesn't mean I am not gonna play a game I paid for. I stand by my reccomendation not buy this game at this time. In the future maybe, but not now.
