This review is totally superfluous. Don't bother reading it. Anything I can say has been said by others before me. Well, if you must read on:

XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within is one of the very best games I have played. And replayed. And replayed. At the time of writing, I am replaying it now on Impossible difficulty, in fact.

You will lose countries to panic. Your best friends will die horrible deaths over and over again (so don't name your soldiers after your friends, eh). Your interceptors will be shot down. Your base will be destroyed shortly after your last soldier falls. Dozens and dozens of civilians will be slaughtered by aliens or turned into zombies. Whales will hold nasty surprises....

Yes, XCOM hits all the right buttons for an amazingly tension filled turn based adventure into the terror of an alien invasion. In the beginning you will be playing catch up, very badly and will wonder why cover is so useless. Just useless.

And then, you figure it out. And the game becomes so addictive that you will be grumpy at work the next day. Your grades will suffer. Your spouse will commit adultery. The world will end due to alien attack. But you won't realise it because you just know there is some way to get to that next MELD cannister before it expires next turn.

If you just move your assault trooper after your sniper has taken out that floater, and you have supressed the overwatch from that muton by blowing it up with a rocket from your heavy trooper, and the MEC has blown a hole in the wall with an alien grenade, but oh, hell, "run and gun" is on cool down, so your support soldier is gonna have to make the run instead of reloading.

But can she cover the distance and activate the cannister? Who knows? The world ends. Stop reading. Just play.
