It is actually difficult to find something wrong with this game. The visuals are stunning, the soundtrack fits the world and events perfectly, the combat is fun and well put together and the lore is phenomenal. Not to mention the multiplayer, which is equal parts intense and satisfying. This game tried some new ideas, and somehow nailed every one of them. By the way, THIS IS AN INDIE GAME. The fact that an indie game can go up against a major game series like Civ and still succeed is a testament to the stellar game design and tireless effort that obviously went into the making Endless Legend.

Summary: This is an instant classic. BUY IT
