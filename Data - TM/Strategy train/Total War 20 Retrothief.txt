Don't do it. 

I love total war. I really do. But this game lacks something. 

The battles are just not compelling. I don't know what the battles are missing, but their just not as fun as previous total wars. 

If you want to try total war, I recommend Total War Shogun 2  it may not be as tactically deep as previous total wars, but its the most polished total war.
