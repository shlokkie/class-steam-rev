+ Hands down the best UI in a 4x game to date.
+ Each playable faction is quite unique compared to most 4x where they just have a couple minor traits and a unique unit. 
+ Heroes with items and skill tree as either generals or city governors
+ Zooming out changes the graphics and lets you see the important stuff easily
+ Customize units, less tedious than usual and very impactful
+ Tech tree is laid out nicely and every tech is impactful
+ In game Marketplace for buying/selling heroes, units, resources, etc
+ Music is really good

If you like 4x this game should be at the top of your list. I prefer it over civilization.
