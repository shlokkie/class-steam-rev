I managed to make it to 2/3 of the way through this war without losing a single soldier. I was riding high, getting win after win and promoting my soldiers by the Skyranger load. We were cleaning the streets, cleaning house, cleaning Earth.

And then it happened... It was supposed to be a standard op, man. It was supposed to be easy. That's what Xcom command said. "Just a downed UFO" they said, "standard sweep and clear."

We were deployed in Western Canada. The target was a UFO a little larger than what we'd encountered before, but we were big boys and girls. We were ready...

We engaged a couple of X Rays outside the front of the downed ship. Nothing we couldn't handle, a couple of Mutons that Sophie 'Baroness' Mercier put down. We were all ready to send the MEC in when it happened.

Kate... she was taking cover to the front, but her right side was exposed.

A God damn Sectopod came out of nowhere, man. It just walked right in, man... Tore her apart...

We beat the thing, we "won" the mission. We even saved mankind a few months later. But nothing was ever really the same after that day.

God bless you, Kate 'Doc' O'Connell
