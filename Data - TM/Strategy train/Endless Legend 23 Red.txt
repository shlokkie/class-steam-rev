Amazing theme, Beautiful world, Lush graphics, Enthralling Lore, playing gives a sense of purpose in the world, Well emphasized factions, Enjoyable combat, Fun to play overall, Elegant UI, Pretty fast paced for a 4x game.

Enough content to get you hooked, not enough content to satisfy what you'll be craving for afterwards. YOU WILL WANT MORE.

I tried to be serious, but damn I'm as happy as a little girl finding out about her crush liking her back.

 I got mocked by lizard people 10/10
