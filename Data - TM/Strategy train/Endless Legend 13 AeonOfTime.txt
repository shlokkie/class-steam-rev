As a huge fan of the Civilization series since its inception, I was skeptical at first trying out Endless Legend. I had a bit of trouble understanding how the game mechanics work, but once everything clicked into place, it was quite a revelation. I am now thoroughly hooked. 

What I love:

The vibrant colors and sharp graphics (Civ actually looks dull compared to this)
The huge amount of original, detailed and superbly animated landscape features
The world of Auriga, winter and summer cycles
The radically different playstyles between factions
The faction main quests and sidequests, well written and challenging
The turn speed, even on large maps with lots going on
The minor factions, original and strategically menaningful
Designing your units

What I found annoying:

The fights. I prefer just doing these on automatic.
The city micromanagement in the later game (although that's shared with all 4X games)
No hero auto level up (I'm nitpicking here)

I would recommend this to everyone who likes 4X games.
