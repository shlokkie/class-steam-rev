imagine you sit in a restaurant, an indian looking man is your waiter, he looks sorta weird, but very friendly. he talks to you as if you have known him for years. you ask for a hamburger and a beer.

you sit peacefully in your chair. time passes quickly, and you see the indian waiter approaching your chair. you assume he will bring you your food and more friendly chit chat.

the indian man looks at you, but this time he says nothing. he puts your plate on your table in front of you.
it's a a steaming, rancid piece of      you assume the indian man laid himself, it looks infected like the sewers of Calcutta. the glass is filled with stinking     .

"What the      is this? i asked for a burger!" you declare,       .
"YOU, SIR, ASKED FOR WAR!" the waiter screams. he then tosses your plate of stinking      into your face and pours the glass of urine all over you.
then all the other people in the restaurant and all the staff all group around you and start beating the      out of you.
you fall to the ground and peg for them to go away. none of them listen, they just keep kicking the life out of you, until you eventually slowly lose all senses and almost drown in a pool of your own blood.

and you still go back to that restaurant every week.
