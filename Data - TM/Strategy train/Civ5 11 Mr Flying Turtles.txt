When Gandhi or Ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. Ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, AND SHOOT THEM LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.

They are evil, traitorous demons. NEVER TRUST THEM.

However, Genghis Khan is my best friend. He came up to me and was all like, "De full do bu la chi mendo." And I said, "Okay! Let's be friends!" I can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works.
