Recently I upgraded my pc and I was thinking of buying Rome 2.
I love all the previous Total War games, I know they have bugs but I choose to overlook them.
But breaking the game to 5 pieces and then selling it. Thanks CA, but NO thanks!!!

Rome 2 Total War = 54,99
Black Sea Colonies = 7.49
Pirates and Riders = 7.49
Greek States = 7.49
Nomadic Tribes = 7.49

Complete game = 84.95 Euros.
(I didn't include the campaign dlcs, i'm only interested in the Grand Campaign)

It's not about if I you can afford it or not, it's about boycotting this type of marketing! Don't buy this game, wait for a gold/complete version.
