Really great 4x game with a wonderful fusion of Science and Fantasy. Lovely graphical design, and nothing feels out of place despite the peculiarities of the setting. I personally am very pleased I picked it up in Early Access, it was a wonderful adventure to see the game mature like it did. Difficulties ramp up very quickly, even on just normal setting (newbie +3) it's very easy to fall behind and not be able to catch back up if something goes wrong.
