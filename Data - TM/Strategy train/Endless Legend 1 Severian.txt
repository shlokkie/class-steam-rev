Pros:
1. Beautiful, intriguing world. Not generic fantasy. Tons of inventive lore infused throughout the game. Even descriptions of the odd map "anomalies" are interesting.
2. Emphasis on effective empire management (vs. constant warfare, as in AOW, Warlock, etc.). City building, economy balancing, and researching the tech circles are immensely satisfying.
3. Combat is done nicely and wars aren't a slog. Tactial battles can be fun to play out, or you can auto resolve without worrying too much. Unit upgrading is fun but not too time consuming.
4. Different races that actually play quite differently. Choose the Vaulters to race for a scientific victory, or the Necrophage to dominant your foes.
4. Some innovative features that haven't been seen in 4x genre. For example: race specific quest lines that actually serve as a unique victory condition, seasonal effects (summer/winter), the concept of regions limiting city placement, reinforcements, how heroes are handled (as generals or governors), etc., etc. 

Cons:
1. Still crashes periodically, esp. after I've been playing for a while.
2. A.I. is deficient. This is the game's greatest threat to long term success. But it is possibly improving with each patch, and I wonder how the modding community's efforts will help.
3. Some of the more nuanced aspects of the game are not obvious and require digging for info on forums, etc.

Summary:
I love turn based strategy games, and I love this game. Absolutely gorgeous and relaxing to play. Nothing better than coming home from a long day at work and watching toddler, locking myself in my office, and playing Endless Legend till 1AM. Plays quicker and smoother than Civ V. Yes, the AI needs improvement, but that's every strategy game since the beginning of time. If the developers support it like they did Endless Space, I think this is going to stay installed on my HD for a long time.
