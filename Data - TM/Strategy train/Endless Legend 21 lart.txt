Tried the 1 hour CIV:BE demo. Too much of the same. So some people were recommending Endless Legend from the creators of Endless Space. I didn't like Endless space at all but this game is different.
It's very much like Civ5 in a fantasy setting and lots of extra stuff added and annoyances removed.
You can choose from 8 totally different factions or build your own one, based on an existing one.
You get side quest, faction questlines, wars that feel reasonable paced, customization for your heroes.
The present AI feels challenging and is exploiting your weaknesses. The autosaves for the last 5 turns may not be enough to save the day.
There are some things I didn't like.
In the late game the performance wasn't that great. Some infrequent crashes here and there plus balancing issues that can make the game much more hard/easy if played wrong/right.
The information overflow or the lack thereof by hiding crucial information, because you didn't know it existed, takes some time to get used to.

Overall if you're looking for an alternative for your typical 4X game, give this game a try. 8/10
