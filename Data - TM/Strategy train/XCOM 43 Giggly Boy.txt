His name was Corey Hawkins, and he was a badass. He'd seen his fair share of battles. He'd lost many friends. After he had ranked up a couple times he'd been awarded the nickname "Bullseye"

...fitting...

14 Missions....46 confirmed kills.

The last mission started like any other. Bullseye and 5 of his buddies attempted to make their way accross a derelict bridge.

The Thin Men. Oh, the Thin Men. They came from nowhere and they came in droves. It was an ambush. The crew readied their guns and begans spraying in every direction. The rookie was hit with a blaster and then poisoned. The life faded from his eyes. Suddenly, the veteran sniper "Chipshot" absorbed a wave of panic. In his terrified stupor he discharged his sniper rifle...

...the bullet flew forward, towards his cohorts...

...the bullet struck the crew leader...

...*critical*....

...and Corey "Bullseye" Hawkins was no more.
