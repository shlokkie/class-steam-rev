First and foremost: This game is for fans of Civilization 1 5, Fallen Enchantress (and its standalone, Legendary Heroes), Master of Magic, Age of Wonders 1 3, and any other 4X game. 

It's like Amplitude took the best parts of Civilization, Master of Magic, Legendary Heroes, their own Endless Space and a few other good 4X games and spun it their own way. 

The strategic layer of managing your economy, build queue, expansion and empire plans are all well done and what you'd expect of a good 4X. The factions are all varied and play uniquely and creatively, each having their own strengths and weaknesses and very distinct looks, both cities and units. The battles are quick, but full of true tactical choices and even strategic choices, as they require knowledge of the terrain and the elevation bonuses to take full advantage of. They're also quick enough to not become the focus of the game, unlike another recent "4X" game with a long history....

What I'm trying to say is that if you like 4X and you want a polished, pretty, and deep game, look no further. The game is, most importantly, fun, even in its BETA state. The AI is competent, though in need of some love (they have time), the balance is getting better with every build and the flow of the game is becoming extremely solid. 

So what are you waiting for? Help support an awesome indie company that is making some excellent games and that costs nearly HALF of what the other "leading" 4X developers are charging.
