XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn based tactics developed by Firaxis and Published by 2K Games. A great games this is.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown is about an alien invasion, well not really a full scale invasion, not yet, but it's an invasion. You are XCOM, an organization that responsible for any threat regarding to allien or anything that comes from outer space. It's quite addictive like Civilization games.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown gameplay is so addictive, build up your base, train and promote your soldiers, research technology based on captured allien tech on the field, build interceptors to take down incoming UFO's, stopping alien assault and abduction of humans, assault alien UFO crash site, it never stops. Soldiers can be customized with armors, better rifles or shotguns, give them some laser weapons and they look like a Stormtroopers. There's also a time when your base will be attacked by the X Rays, it's what they called the alien there since they don't really know what those aliens are, so many creatures. So much to do.

XCOM: Enemy Unknown, for a strategy games, it has quite great graphics and effects, better detailed and all. Performance are perfectly great, no issues whatsoever.

If only modding is officially supported, nevertheless I recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown.

Rating 9/10
