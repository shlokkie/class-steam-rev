I just started playing, and I love it.
It is still lacking some 4x Basics like real diplomacy but it's an early access, so I just wait till it's added.

You could compare it to Civ just in a Fantasy setting, and with Hero Units.

For any 4x Fan, this is a buy.

Update:
There is 200 Turns limit for now(I hope it will be removed). This is somewhat annoying.
The AI is a little bit too aggressive, 2 Turns after meeting them, the AI declared war and attacked my Cities. This happened in each session I played. So in fact I just need to focus on a strong army in the beginning or I won't even reach the turn limit :(

What is pretty awesome that there are neutral factions (minor factions) which consist only of small cities. If you destroy and rebuild their city or complete a quest for them you can assimilate this faction and benefit from some small boost and a new unit which is unique for this faction.

I still like the fact that there are random quests where you can find new gear or ressources, this keeps each play fresh.
