I played total war for countless hours.....all the way back since shogun 1.

And even if the game has been upddated so the AI isent completely          anymore.
Its still very weak challenge.

Oh and the DLC horror! 
You would kinda think when you buy a emperor editon or masters collection it would include        overpriced DLC

2.49€ for a blood and core DLC..........wow since that should not be part of the game as standard.
Half complete game is what this is.......want to complete it? will cost you another 70€ for all the DLC outside sales.

Buy shogun or one of the older games its a better buy and a finished game in comparison
