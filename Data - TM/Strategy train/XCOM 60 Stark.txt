A very good game, for all you strategy game fans out there. Has a few issues and can sometimes feel unfair but for the most part a fun and very absorbing experiance. Lots of organic and unique encounters and has a really awesome concept behind it. Its one of those few games where you can actually loose or be 10 hours in and have no hope of ever winning. Its a really tense and exciting game. However some missions can become incredibley tedious and too repetitive at times. Im looking at you EXALT missions...

Overall a fun time and tons of replayibility 9/10
