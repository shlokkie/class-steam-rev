Great tactical game. In some ways its quite limited here and there compared to original X Com titles of 80s, but overall, I'm loving this game.

Things to love about XCOM:
  replayability   every new game is fun in its own way
  hella lots of fun with 2nd wave options (after you complete the game and decide to start another one, some new options unlock, randomizing your game)
  great customization (make sure you get all DLCs for this)
  interesting missions, good map variety (Enemy Within, Slingshot DLCs)
  the game sometimes gets quite brutal, wiping your team in a matter of seconds. Now try playing in Ironman mode, where you can't load! While this feels horrible, it forces you to learn your sub optimal strategy won't work well in higher difficulties. Which is a good thing, overall.

Things to note:
  losing soldiers makes you feel bad
  enemies hitting with unrealistic odds every now and then
  your soldiers may miss 3 4 shots with 80 99% accuracy, one after another (don't worry, 100% shots always hit, although they may miss even at point blank if its not 100%)
  some game mechanics seem weird and take time getting used to
  loading a game won't make your soldier hit instead of missing. More than that   your soldier may actually miss instead of hitting!
  skipping a DLC mission will make it never return (in Enemy Within), so don't skip it. It comes back in Enemy Unknown. Launcher treats these as separate games.
  some bugs 3 years after release. Nothing game breaking, though.

Overall   I absolutely LOVE this game and highly recommend anyone who played Xcom of the past or any tactical shooters. Turn based tactical shooters.
