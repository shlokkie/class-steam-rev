Came into this game expecting something akin to Civ 5, and was pleaseantly suprised to find that I enjoy it much more.

The AI is a bit more challenging for early and mid game, the factions all seem to have their unique niche/gameplay mechanics, the map has a cool elevation system and active weather, and the RPG like elements have a cool feel to them as you customize your units and work through the faction stories.

I find myself losing track of time as I play. Nice job Amplitude!
