[Cool, one of the most popular reviews out there for this game.]

*ahem*
FROM THE MAKERS OF CIVILIZATION

COMES A GAME

ABOUT IT'S LAST STAND

WHERE CIVILIZATION DOES NOT SEEM THAT SUPPORTIVE OF IT'S OWN ATTEMPT AT SURVIVAL

ENGAGE IN THRILLING COMBAT WHERE MOST OF THE COMBAT WILL OCCUR RIGHT BEFORE YOU FINISH STUDYING THAT ONE PLASMA WEAPON THAT NO ONE WILL FUND, NO ONE WANTS TO BUY, BUT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO MAKE IT PAST THAT ONE    oh, come on! Seriously? A terror mission right now? This sucks.

ATTEMPT TO PROTECT THE EARTH FROM AN ARMY OF ALIENS THAT THE CONCEPT OF CLOTHING IS COMPLETELY NEW TO THEM, BUT COMPLETE DOMINATION IS NOT

SAVE COUNTRIES THAT WON'T FUND YOUR OPERATION IF THEIR LIVES DEPENDED ON IT (oh wait, it does) FROM AFOREMENTIONED ALIENS THAT CAN HIT YOUR SOLDIER FROM A RIDICULOUS DISTANCE AWAY AND IMMEDIATLEY HOSPITALIZE THEM FOR WEEKS (or, alternatively, immediatley kill them) CAUSING PANIC AMONG YOUR STRONGEST SOLDIER, CAUSING THEM TO BE UTTERLY USELESS

GAIN MONEY IN THE SAME WAY HEADHUNTERS DO: BY SELLING DEAD BODIES. THE MILLION DOLLAR WORTH LASER SNIPER ISN'T WHAT THEY WANT, THEY WANT A MUTILATED EXTRATERRESTRIAL CORPSE

WITH THE "ENEMY WITHIN" EXPANSION, SAVE LIVES IN THE AMERICAN WAY: BY FIGHTING TERRORISTS THAT ARE JUST AS POWERFUL AS A CYBERDISC BUILT BY THE FBI WHO CAN:
 Request backup from an infinite supply of soldiers
 Do operations faster than you can build an aircraft
 Fall from the air the same way aliens do, with no physical damage whatsoever, despite falling from who knows where
 And carry more blood in their bodies than a Muton

STARRING:
 HOPELESS ODDS

 CHEATING AIs

 RESEARCHERS WHO DON'T RESEARCH

 ENGINEERS WHO DON'T ENGINEER

 SOLDIERS WHO SUCK AT THEIR JOB

 SOLDIERS WHO ARE DECENT AT THEIR JOB (sort of)

  THAT ONE EPIC SNIPER WHO BASICALLY RULES XCOM

 INCONVIENIENT TERROR MISSIONS

 WORTHLESS COUNTRIES WHO DON'T FUND OR SUPPORT YOU

 A BARRAGE OF STUPID HAIRSTYLES

  THE HONEST TRAILER GUY (wait, I meant the Council dude)

NOT STARRING:
  ACTUAL FUNDING

  THE ABILITY TO BUILD MORE THAN ONE SKYRANGER

  THE ABILITY TO SEND MULTIPLE SQUADS TO MULTIPLE PANIC SITES

  INTELLIGENT TEAMMATES WHO WON'T TRY TO MURDER THEIR SQUAD

  FAST RESEARCH

XCOM: ENEMY UNFAIR
