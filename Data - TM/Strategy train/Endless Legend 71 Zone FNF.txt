Absolutely wonder strategy game with a suprising amount fo content for an Early Access Game. Endless Legend plays off an randomy generated map world a la Civilization. Currently there's 4 different factions inside the game. So far I've only played the Vaulters, a techological race focoused upon research. It would seem as though all the factions start off with 1 major and 1 minor perk along with a few pre researched techs and a few basic units. Ofcouse, all of this is different for each of the 4 factions currently present. 

The game play map is fully relealized filled with interesting zones that influnce your city building ways. I see that many of the elements from the Endless space game appears, namely a wonder GUI, meaningful quests and city govenors. 

Combat inside the game plays out half like an RPG and half in a form similar to Age of Wonders III and The might and magic series. Amplitude has applied some of the elements from endless space. Battles are started by units on the strategy map and are fought like small turn based battles like say fire emblie or advanced wars. Heroes also make a role as units that you can level up, choose perks, and equip with items.
