With the Steam sale coming up I recommend keeping an eye out for XCOM: Enemy Unknown & the Enemy Within expansion for the base game; Enemy Unknown was pretty dam good, but Enemy Within really adds the icing on the cake in terms of a new sub campaign, new techs, new classes of soldier, new enemies and a more fleshed out customisation system for your own troops. But if you want to see a fairly faithful recreation of the original XCOM series in three dimensions it is certainly worth a look; or even if you never played the original XCOM games then this is an excellent turn based, squad level combat simulator with a fairly comprehensive turn based RTS system housing that.
