Germany.... America.... India.... Poland....

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when India attacked. Only the Polish, masters of all four victory types, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they vanished.

A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered a new Polish nation, lead by a king named Casimir III. And although his domination skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

But I believe, Poland can save the world.
