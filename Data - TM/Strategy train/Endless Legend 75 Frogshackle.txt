For nearly 30 hours, I have tried repeatedly to find the "hook" for this game and I look back at 30 hours spent banging my head into a wall in an attempt to squeeze some sort of enjoyment out of this game without success.

The game is gorgeous, the audio is nice, the lore is engaging, the UI is *mostly* efficient and intuitive but ultimately the mechanics feel awkward and grossly unintuitive. I feel that many changes were introduced into the typical 4x formula more out of a desire for novelty than genuine improvement over tried and true systems. It's not praise when I state that every time I put this game aside for a month or two and come back to it that I am nearly at a complete loss as to how to play/enjoy the damned thing.

Part of the allure of a strategy game is in untangling its mass of interconnected parts and learning a new series of mechanics and how they affect each other and the overall thrust of the game but I feel that the awkward learning curve of Endless Legend lacks the payoff in gameplay that makes the effort feel worthwhile. Most of the mechanics revolve around maximizing an endless pile of tiny modifiers that work invisibly most of the time and don't really contribute to an impression of growing an empire. The spreadsheet y nature of 4x games is just too front and center for this one and in board game terms, I feel like I'm playing a euro style abstract victory point chase rather than a more viceral, thematic war game. 

I am not baffled by the popularity of this game and can see how it would be very appealling with gamers of a different stripe than myself but for me, the only reason that I keep coming back to the game and giving it another go is that I am chasing after the same enjoyment (and failing to find it).
