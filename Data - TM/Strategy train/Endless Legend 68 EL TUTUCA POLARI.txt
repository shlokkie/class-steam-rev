I am baffled as to how this game could reinvent the civilization formula with so much originality that it makes me wish the civilization series would actually learn from this.

Extremely fine art and an absolutely gorgeous map, and lots to do. And I do find it quite hard. I still have to play many many hours but I am enjoying this a lot. All of the races are interesting and it is a first that I'm actually playing everything random.

9/10. Excellent
