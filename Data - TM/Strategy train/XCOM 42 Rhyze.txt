So my noob friend (Ultimate ace) though he could beat me in a 1v1, after he declaired the chryssalid unit banned due to me winning our first 1v1 by soloing his whole team with it.

He went first and though he was pretty good getting to the camp spot, inside chuck E cheese before me. He puts all his units on overwatch and waits for me to make a move.

I decided i had enough of this camping so I flanked 2 cyber disks down from the roof of chuck E cheese, while simutaniously ramming through the wall with my brute unit. Ultimate Ace had 3 Marines onto the brute. 70% hit rate. First Marine Miss. Second marine fires 75% hitrate. Miss. third marine fires 80% hitrate. Miss.

He was getting pretty desperate as the brute one shotted marine number 3 and 2. so he pulled out his ultimate mind control alien and took over my brute. My cyber disks take aim from a long distance. 45% hitrate. one shots the mind control alien. At this point everything was just going downhill for Ultimate ace as my mechs push through Chuck E cheese with no threat and clean up everything.

He has not played the game since.
