The graphic detail is really great and the factions are interesting. My giving it a thumbs down comes from a couple of key issues. 1. The research options aren't as tactically linked as Civ 5, it's hard to see how your choices are going to offer you any andvantages over your rivals. 2. The way you seige a city is frustrating, especially if the random army of two, seiges your heavily fortified city with troops and all, halting your production, but no clear way to attack them with any advantage. Maybe I'm missing something? 3. The diplomacy part, just seems wrong, you end up having to commit way too much resources to get anything in return, allies switch on a turn for little reason. 4. likely my biggest issue with the game, and maybe it's because of the CIV brainwash, but you don't really exploit tiles in the same way. You get the whole land mass, your cities have limited growth and yes you can extract resources and so forth, but you just don't have control over the individual hexes. Just could never feel that my decisions after a 100 turns was driving me to any specific strategic victory. Yet the AI was getting close to a victory somehow.
