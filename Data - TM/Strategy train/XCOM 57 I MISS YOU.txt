It makes me want to rename one of my soldier, put my ex girlfriend name on her, and let her die in the field. But then again, if I do that, I'd care for my soldier, no matter what her name is, and if I lose that soldier, I'll be sad. Even if it's just my ex girlfriend, one that I've hated for years, with all my beings.

Your soldier matters, people in real life doesn't. That's XCOM to me.
