One day, there was a rookie.
His name was Ricardo Perez.
Him and a team of rookies went on a mission that day to clear an area.
Everyone on the team died.
Except Perez.
He killed everyone by himself.
The next day he got a promotion to Squaddie, and he became a heavy.
His nickname was 'Hulk'.
He always preformed very well, and he always carried the team.
He was going from promotion to promotion very quickly, and he was soon the best soldier in XCOM.
The mission was to explore a downed UFO, and Perez was expecting the final promotion, Colonel.
It was his dream to finally surpass his father.
My best sniper, Svetsky, was wounded by an ambush.
Perez used a medkit and revived him.
Svetsky ran to higher ground to snipe.
Perez didn't have enough time to escape the alien that ambushed Svetsky.
Mj.Perez was killed.

1. Lie down.
2. Try not to cry.
3. Cry a lot.

Why do I get so emotionally attached to my troops?
