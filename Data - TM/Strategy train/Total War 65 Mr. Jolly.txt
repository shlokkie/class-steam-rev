All the "new features" are lies. Politics system? What politics system? You don't feel like you're running a nation or that you have any impact on the world what so ever. If you want politics buy Victoria 2.

The total war series is on it's last legs, they need to truly re invent this game. Waste of money and time. I couldn't even complete one campaign because I just ended up getting bored after expanding a bit. All this game is is you trying to turn the map to your colour; that's it, no joke. The combat is dull and very much the same as every total war game except with LESS features. Shogun 2 was far more in deph than this rubbish but not in deph enough.

A true scam, just a lot of hype about nothing. I won't be buying the next one.
