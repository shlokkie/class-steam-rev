XCOM: Enemy Unknown is incredibly fun. I love turn based games and this takes strategy to the fullest. In this game it is man vs. alien and we are fighting back to remove the aliens. You control a squad of soldiers that you move and tell them who to attack, defend, or to do overwatch to attack moving enemies. There are four types of soldiers you can get randomly when they level up and each will gain rank and you choose from 1 or 2 abilities when they do. If your soldiers die you have a chance to save them by healing them before they die but if they die they are gone forever. You also have the build up your forces by researching technology and spending resources to buy new technologies, weapons, and buildings.

This is a highly addictive game which can be pretty difficult if you don't cheat (save often and reload over and over again to get the best results). An interesting thing about XCom is it saves its random number generator so that means if you load a game and do the same actions over again you will get the same results but if you do things in a different order you can get different results (the chances to hit will be the same but if one soldier is more likely to hit, he might hit an enemy when another would miss).

The only thing I didn't like about this game is it seems to be very short to finish one playthrough but you could always play again with a higher difficulty or it also comes with Second Wave which lets you chance certain settings in the game. I would highly recommend if you like turn based strategy games.
