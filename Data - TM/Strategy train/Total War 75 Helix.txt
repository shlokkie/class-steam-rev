2 and a half ish months later, and 200 hours into it...I am finally able to say Rome 2 is worth buying.
On release this game was comparaby as awful as Empire on release. The AI didn't function, the graphics options and optimization were a joke, many major and critical campaign map features were almost as non functioning as the unit pathing in battles....
But that was then.

Creative Assembly has applied patch after patch for the last few months, added a fair amount of Free LC, and an expansion that adds seasonal graphics. In addition, CA has released the official mod tools and construction kit....meaning the Steam Workshop for Rome II is loaded with goodies now.

I highly recommend the "Divide et Impera" mod for the ultimate experience, as well as the "G.E.M" or "Graphical Enhancements Mod". Divide et Imperia (or DeI) adds a terrific new array of historically accurate units to nearly every faction, new skills/traits for generals and agents, improved textures on all existing units, 4 turns per year with spring/summer/fall/winter seasonal effects (graphical and technical, like agriculture and happiness), and much more to fix the battles and unit morale/defense/offense. G.E.M. removes the absolutely useless and irritating Instagram Filters that the game used, and it adds MSAA to replace the blurry and hideous FXAA that the game comes with.

So what is Rome II now? Is it a worthy sequel to Rome I? Well, no. The soundtrack, the lack of family trees, the lackluster siege battles, and the many other little glitches and missing features still bog down the game. But it's absolutely worth a purchase. With a little modding it's up there (in my opinion) with Shogun 2 and Medieval 2. Definitely better than Empire, but it can't quite reach the polish and wholesome experiences that Rome 1 and Napoleon still provide.
