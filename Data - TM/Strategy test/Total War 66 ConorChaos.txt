Where to start with Rome 2..? Well, it looks nice I guess, but promised way too much. If you're coming to this from Rome: Total War then you'll notice a lot that is different and not so much in a good way. The game is literally still riddled with game breaking bugs 1 year from release, even after hefty patching that seems to have just covered up an otherwise sinking boat. AI that doesn't know how to siege your settlements, the game engine itself struggling to cope with 2 full armies on the field at once resulting in a perfect FPS on your part but the units in game moving in a stuttering motion being just one bug that's been there from release and has yet to be fixed, The huge battles take such a toll on your system even though on paper your machine should be able to smash this game, leaving you feeling bitter for the price you've had to pay for a series that keeps letting it's fans down but lying to them to get their money again.
There are a few interesting features like on the campaign map how you have to deal with dilemma's in your empire, I like that, makes you feel like your involved with you populace on a personal level. There is a large unit variety which is nice but after a certain point, if you're not playing as Rome, your empires tech just stops which has also been a problem in previous Total War titles, for example. Rome has a meagre power in your game but they can still happen upon the tech for their heavily armoured and well trained legions yet if you're playing as another faction then a few upgrades later is all you're going to get. 
There is too much that is wrong with this game and I've found that contradicting something the Creative Assembly has said gets you insta hate from their fanboys which is a constant on the forums or blocked entirely from saying anything constructive about the game at all. With a mix of bad customer service, bare faced lying to their customers and combined with a broken game, this Total War game isn't worth your attention unless it's on sale for a very low price.
