As an owner of every single Total War game up until recently, this is another game I wanted to like but never managed to.

The game has advanced graphically, but not in other aspects. Some mechanics have changed, lacking real innovations and its hard to objectively say any single new mechanic is "better" then its previous iteration.

Waiting times ingame are very long, loading is frequent and time consuming. Even on a healthy quadcore with plenty of RAM, the game is very slow overall. An SSD would adress the loading times, but would do nothing for the slow decission making process the AI seems to suffer from.

I remember having similar issues with Rome: Total War. As my hardware improved over the years, this game became a lot more fluent.

Perhaps in a few years the hardware will be available to make this game play with the fluency required for some level of immersion. Currently, this is too slow of a game for me, making me stick to older incarnations of the game.

As a final point, given all the above, the price is far too high, and bringing out DLC while having a faulty base product, is really low.
