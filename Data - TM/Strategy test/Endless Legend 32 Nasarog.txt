The first time I heard about this new project from Amplitude, I got very excited. VERY VERY EXCITED. I loved Endless Space (even with it's shortcomings). I knew what I wanted to be there, and from the feature list and reading on the forums, I knew that EL would have almost all of it, with the potential for all of it with Amplitudes propensity to give free add ons and support. The game is absolutely beautiful. It has all of the common fantasy tropes (a good thing) but each has a twist (even better). City spam? GONE. Unique tech? present. Fun factions? there in spades. Tactical combat? Indeed (and getting better). Lots of resources?.. I'm in heaven. Naval combat? coming soon. Minor factions? oh yea!!! I'm sold. The A.I. is getting better in both combat and city/unit management (very important). As a community, we the players suggest, and Amplitude is still istening and making changes. We even got a faction added to the game. By the community, for the community. Amplitude really is working with us. Now, to the game. I love the winter mechanic because it acts like an enemy (Winter is coming after all). The planet has a volatile nature and it moves from the carrot to the stick at the drop of a hat. One moment summer is there and your economy is in full swing, then winter hits, and you are wondering if you'll be the same after it passes. Auriga (the planet we're on) is dying, and it's time to leave. Many different ways of doing that. The usual victory conditions: Domination, science, military and more. It has a robust quest system that will get more depth as the devs continue to add components to the game (co op quests perhaps). Hero leveling that actually has meaning. Meaningful (still getting balanced) unit and weapon design. No two regions are the same because of the location of the crucial resources. You get to plan it out as you decide how to grow your empire. One of the factions, Roving Clans, even gives you a do over if you find a better settlement options because your scarab cities can move. How cool is that!!! As you pacify the minor factions, you get to chose a couple to join your ranks. But wait, you wanted that other one... you know.. the one that your enemy controls!!!!! No problem, just buy it on the market place and make it a privateer. Now you can wage war, without waging war.... Nice!!! I can keep going, but why spoil all the surprises. Oh yea, I love the changes to the UI that they implemented since ES. LOVE THEM!!!

That was the good. Now the bad. 

The game is a graphics hog, and it can be slow between turns and during combat. Make sure you have a fast machine with a good graphics card, or play on lower settings. The A.I. can be rather obtuse sometimes, but then again, when have you played a 4x game with a strong and well rounded A.I. from the get go? me? never. The tool tips could be better because there is soooo much going on. They need a more in depth tutorial that isn't so boring. I was bored, I couldn't finish it. Naval combat and aquatic resources are mostly missing, but we're told that is their next major thing, as well as espionage. Nice!!!

I am sure there is something I'm leaving out, but I hit all the main points.

Updated December 6th, 2015: I would give Endless Legend at it's current state 9.25/10. All the patching and additions have realy brought up the score. This game is fantastic. I highly recommend it. Go out and get it.. go go go!!!

Update #1: March 28th, 2015   Three free add ons have added much requested features and extended the gameplay. The AI has improved and the bugs are all but disappeared. I can honestly say that the game is a 8.9 or almost a 9. So close. If you are still hesitating, don't.

Update #2: April 29th, 2015   The release of the Guardians DLC really improves on the early and mid game. Your choices now have meaning that carries through the late game. Titan units with co op quests and legendary buildings? Where do I sign up. Oh yea, right here. I can't wait to see what else comes from AMPLITUDE Studios.

Update #3: October 1st, 2015   The Shadows DLC is amazing. It finally brings us the espionage mechanic all the while introducing an espionage focused faction called the Forgotten. The single player game has improved, but the multiplayer game is where it's att. Continued support and incorporation of community feedback has made EL one of the best 4X MP experiences out there. The espionage mechanic makes consider some really important choices. Use heroes to command your armies, as city administrators or foreign spies. You can now pillage and loot. YOu have invisible armies on the field. So much to do... 

Update #4: Demeber 6th, 2015   Echoes of Auriga and the Lost tales are two mini DLC (paid) that add additional quests, events and new music by FlyByNo. Amplitude knows how to keep you engaged with compelling lore and music. Both of these tiny DLC are worth every penny.

Another part of this update is the FREE DLC called Forges of Creation. Within it, Amplitude has put in some serious effort into updating the A.I., which by the way is getting much better. It also has a solid balancing pass from SP/MP gameplay. But, the reason it's named thus has to do with moding and Steam workshop support. This one has both. Finally!!!

Keep up the great work Amplitude Studios.
