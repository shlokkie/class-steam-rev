Xcom is pretty tragic, I guess.

You play as a commander for Xcom, an organization with a fatality in the thousands. Your duty is to stop dirty alien        s from descending from that place where baby Jesus may or may not live, and killing everyone you've ever known and love. Don't worry, everyone you know and love will still die, only at a slower rate. With the world's leaders at your back, you recruit soldiers, engineers, and scientists from the greatest bunch of cowards planet earth can provide.

After you set up your base, you begin researching, purchasing, and building, using satellites to watch the skies for the spooky aliens. When one of those grey        s finally decides to show it's big dumb stinky head, you shoot down it's stupid looking space craft and send your friends to die horrible, brutal deaths.

Oh yeah, and you can customize the name's and appearances of all your Xcom operatives, so you get super attached to them right before a horrible spider creature disembowls the guy and lays eggs in his scrotum. I will never forget you Stinky Poo Poo Marine. But it only goes downhill from there when you realize that the crotch eggs turned your bff into a zombie which will then explode into a crotch alien that in turn can turn the rest of your squad into angry crotch aliens. I will never forget you, Stinky Poo Poo Squad.

Combat with the little green men is handled turn based, and unlike it's predecessor games, you actually have a chance to bring someone home alive instead of drowning your enemies in corpses. You take turns moving your units around cover to take pot shots or flank the aliens in small scale squad combat. And while the enemy brings powers and weapons far beyond your own, you have your own advantages as well such as actually being able to aim or your soldier panicking and actually shooting at the enemy that made him panic.

It's not all hopeless, though. In between the murders of your best friends and the pants wetting terror that your operatives endure, things slowly begin to go your way. The more aliens you wipe out, the more space stuff you pick up, the more space stuff you pick up the more stuff you can research. But the end of the game, after all the aliens have been sliced open and eaten, I mean researched, and all of the space guns have been carefully looked at. The operatives lucky enough not to get their skulls punched out the back of their heads gained enough new equipment and experience to go head to head with even the toughest alien.
Sectoids become a nuisance at best, Muton's who were once like mini boss fights become the standard infantry you have to contend with, and all the big scary robots that the aliens used to have romantic evenings with your operatives sphincters are completely over come by being covered in a large angry blanket of plasma fire. It's quite the empowering experience to be the ones doing the alien      pushing instead of the other way around.

The expansion pack goes even further beyond, adding a human enemy faction that likes to take your lasers in the face the same way fat kids like to eat cake, as well as giving you the opportunity to make both battle jedi and giant robot men that make you feel safe in their big strong arms.

But should you play X Com Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within?
Yes, you should. While one can argue that it's nowhere near as expansive or in depth as the original series, it offers a newer and more accessible way to enter a fairly old and reveared series. It's a gateway drug into the older and more demanding games. Just don't go naming your soldiers after your high school crush if you don't want to see her murdered and eaten by crab spiders.

I give DBomb: Adversary confused/ Combatant Inside, Seven old timey UFO movies out a possible four War of the World remakes.

I saw the face of god and it was weeping.

Oh yeah, the curator.
