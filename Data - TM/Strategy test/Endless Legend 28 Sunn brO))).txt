One of the most original and innovative 4x games to come out in years. Eight wildly varied factions (each with their own unique, expansive plotlines), a host of really interesting, unique mechanics (only one city per district, no tech tree). Most of the mechanics are very intuitive, but offer some pretty significant depth.

This came out at the same time as Beyond Earth, but it's been much better received, and the reason for that is simple  it has personality. Playing with each of the factions is like starting a different singleplayer game, and the faction creator is very flexible. Like its predecessor, Endless Space, the game also has fantastic, understated art and music. 

The only problems are that some of the more advanced faction specific mechanics are poorly explained, and that the AI can sometimes be poor at defending their cities. Amplitude have patched this, but some more work remains to be done.

Overall, the most fun I've had with a 4x since Alpha Centauri.
