Total War: Rome 2 is a game with serious flaws. It was released with severe bugs; three months (not to mention seven patches) later I still experience occasional, unexplainable crashes. Gameplay wise, the interface is poor, the AI makes mind boggling decisions during battles and in the campaign, and the graphics leave something to be desired: even with all settings on Extreme I can't seem to get near the quality of those damnable screenshots. Oh, and the Blood & Gore setting    a standard option in most games    is sold as DLC. As if a $60 dollar game shouldn't have that option by default.

On the flip side, the game is eminently moddable, so if you're open to experimentation you could search for mods that make the game entertaining for you. Or create those mods yourself! And hey, despite all its rough edges, I still find Rome 2 sometimes engrossing, and you might too if you're a fan of large scale strategy... Yet I can't help but feel that I'm forcing myself to play just so I can say I got my money's worth.
