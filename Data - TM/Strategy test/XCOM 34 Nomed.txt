Xcom Enemy Unknown is a great reboot to the Xcom franchise.

It's your job to defend the planet from a massive alien invasion. The game does a great job conveying a strong sense of urgency along with a risk/reward system as you're often forced to make difficult decisions.

The game offers tactical combat, and RPG elements. Your soldiers will level up and unlock new abilities while scientific research awards access to new weapons, armor, and gadgets.

The game is great and definitely worth buying.
