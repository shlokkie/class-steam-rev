Good turn based fantasy strategy game without the standard fantasy fare. Unique takes on most things make it visually entertaining. Less of a Civ clone than you might think, but you can see influences. Minor races instead of city states for example, but you end up recruiting them into your nation instead of interacting with them in other ways. It borrows some mechanics such as heroes and resources from Endless Space, which isn't a bad thing.

One of the best turn based fantasy strategy games of the Civ clone ilk I've played, though the AI was somewhat lame on the average difficult levels. They played well except the peaceful ones had next to no military. I waltzed through their lands with nary a concern.
