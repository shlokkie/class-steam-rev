Must... defend... earth... from alien scum... FOREVER!

Also game has made me really want to buy the damn expansion even at full price which is pretty rare. Seems to add some much needed variety in the gameplay since the base game can get boring after you master it since it basically requires you to be super cautious and inch your way forward on classic and especially impossible in order to have a shot at victory.

The comparisons to strategy JRPGs is valid I think. Then again I was a huge fan of FFT and vandal hearts when I was a kid so yeah done right they are awesome.
