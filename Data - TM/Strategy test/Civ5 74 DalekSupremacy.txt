What else to say than: "Just... One... More... Turn..."

The legendary series/franchise/time consuming void, that is Civilization, continues to conquer the hearts of all us would be world leaders who lacks the ambition, and are too lazy, to strive for power outside of the digital realm.

To ascertain whether or not to play Civilization, there is really only one question you need ask yourself:
"How many days off can i afford before getting fired?"

If the answer is below five, you should probably leave now. I'm serious. Leave!

Anyhow. If you have never before played Civilization, you owe it to yourself to try it. You will not regret it. (except for when you get fired, of course.)

It is simply awe inspiringly brilliant. An epic journey through history. Rewriting history.
