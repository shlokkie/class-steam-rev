Normal   learn the ropes and enjoy the game

Classical   watch your entire squad get taken out by the weakest enemy, then get annoyed and throw your troops unprepared into the most dangerous of situations. That'll teach XCOM for kicking my    !

Absolutely awesome game and MUST be played on Ironman mode to get the true experience   save scumming completely destroys the mood and feeling.

Just don't play classical until you've developed a thick hide/found a way to cry inside without any external physical tears.
