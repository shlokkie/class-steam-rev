This was probably the biggest let down of the year. A longtime total war fan, I had high hopes for Rome 2. Unfortunately it was bogged down by poor gameplay and poor optimization. Even three months later after launch, it's still plagued by poor AI. The modding community has come together to fix what they can, but even they can only do so much. It's really sad. What's more troubling is how much the game developers promised and promoted, leaving content out and selling it as DLC.

I cannot recommend this game at all. It has its moments where it shines, but just as you're getting in to it, you are let down by performance issues, bugs, or bad AI.

Edit: Rome 2 Emperor Edtition review

CA updated the game all year, releasing 15 different patches. Finally, with the Emperor Edition, it's in a playable state instead of a beta. It's not perfect; there are still some optimization issues and even if you have a high end PC you are going to experience Framerate issues as well as stuttering in certain occasions  like during sieges when units are climing up and down walls/fighting on walls. 

The EE update improved a lot of things, including campaign AI and battle AI, and a slight visual update. It's worth playing now, but I still wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it. At this point I would wait for it to go on sale, particularly since TW: Attila is coming out in february. 

I give props to CA for continuing to support their game and constantly updating, but it was too little too late in my opinion. I spent more hours testing and fine tuning than playing throughout the year. There were a lot of immersion breaking issues, and there still are a few even now. Nothing kills your fun like seeing units stutter around on the walls, and while CA is still working to fix this, they release silly nonsense like the Women of Mars DLC and the Halloween update to keep us distracted until they can figure out how to fix it.
