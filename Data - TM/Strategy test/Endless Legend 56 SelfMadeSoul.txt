After about a dozen Early Access disasters, Endless legend is probably the first game that I bought at release and WISH that I had bought in Early Access. This game has it all. A real in depth strategical engine, factions that actually change the way that the game is played for once, and a compelling story (in a 4X game no less!).

And the ART! Every time I see a new painting in a faction quest, I've got a new desktop background. Sometimes, in the mid to late game, I take a break and just zoom in and look at all of the cities and terrain in my empire... its gorgeous! When Steam announced their Music service, this was the first soundtrack that I thought of... and I'm not a soundtrack guy at all.

This game was originally purchased to "hold me over" until Civ: Beyond Earth came out. Now, I can't even remember CBE's release date. If you're on the fence on whether you want a challenging fantasy 4X game that does everything right, then I strongly encourage you to guzzle the kool aid from a firehose.
