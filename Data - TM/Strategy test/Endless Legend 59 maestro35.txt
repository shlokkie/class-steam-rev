Firstly, I would like to thank the 4X enthusiast group eXplorminate for giving away this game. I typically don't pay much attention to giveaways, but I actually won something that time. And that something happened to be a game that seemed somewhat fascinating to me at the time.

As of now, Endless Legend is a whole lot more than "mildly fascinating," and I am shocked I did not know about it sooner. This is one of the few games that I wish so many more people did know about. My opinion of this game is from the perspective of a[nother] person stepping into it from Civilization V. I also have some Total War to be comparing it to, so I have that to reference as well. That said....

Endless Legend is a beautiful game. There are few other words that can describe it so aptly. The presentation of Auriga (the gameworld) from the map anomalies to the tile improvements that match the civilization's stylistic impressions to the special effects during winter to the GUI, everything about the game is beautiful. The UI deserves a special shout out, because everything is placed so intuitively, and it's simple, clean, and elegant. There is no other game that matches the polish of Endless Legend's UI (although vanilla Civ and G+K were both very meticulous through the menus and what not). As a turn based strategy, the gameplay is sufficiently balanced, and the overall war mechanic is somewhat more sophisticated than what you'd find in Civilization, using Total War's army building model. The quest functionality provides a lot of deep lore, and it really is amazing how intricate Amplitude's universe is   they have clearly committed a lot of energy to just... being creative here   so I have to mention it even though I really don't care for it much in my playthroughs. I don't have to, though. It's there if you want it, but I'm just not an RPG person. My biggest gripe about the game is how much ALL CAPS ARE USED IN ITEM DESCRIPTIONS. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING TO READ.

All in all, it's a fantasy version of Civ that is very, very polished, endlessly replayable (see what I did there?), full of character, surprisingly strong on the war/conflict front, and I am recommending it now solely because I want more people to know about it. I encourage you to pick it up, or at least look into it a little deeper.
