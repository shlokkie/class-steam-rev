#Classifying Steam Reviews - Text Mining
  
For our master class in Data Mining, we did a Text Mining task. For this assignment we decided to look at the Steam® platform, software and market place for computer games, and use the reviews made inside the platform by users. This feature of the platform is one of the reasons it became such a huge business success in the last few years: these are reliable and easily accessible peer reviews that can be filtered in many different ways.   
  
We decided to use the Text Mining tools to apply to reviews of games of two different genres and check if an algorithm could classify their genres correctly. We realized we needed a substantial sample of reviews, so we chose games based on their popularity and therefore number of reviews. We would be then focusing on those reviews that got the best ratings from users. 
  
When it came to selecting which genre we should pick, we decided to go for two which were significantly different and within which there was no overlap. We chose the user defined tags ‘Psychological Horror’ and ‘Turn Based Strategy’(TBS), for which we couldn’t find any games with both tags. This choice should make the classification task somewhat easier. The games that made up our sample were, for ‘Turned based Strategy’: XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Sid Meier's Civilization® V, Total War™: ROME II - Emperor Edition and Endless Legend. For ‘Psychological Horror’ we picked Amnesia, Outlast, SOMA and DreadOut.
